## Abstract

Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding, their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation. This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce ShotBench , a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed (predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60% average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct ShotQA , a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k cinematic QApairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop ShotVL through supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on ShotBench, establishing new stateof-the-art performance. We open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

## 1 Introduction

Cinematography, the art of crafting visual narratives through meticulously designed shots [4, 17], forms the bedrock of high-quality filmmaking. Each shot, from framing and lens choice to lighting and camera movement, is deliberately composed to convey narrative meaning, emotional tone, and aesthetic impact. For text-to-image/video generation [2, 11, 23, 24, 40, 59] to achieve similar cinematic quality, it requires a mechanism capable of understanding these cinematographic principles. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) [3, 26, 33, 35, 48, 61, 65] are the primary candidates for developing such understanding. Thus, the core challenge is whether current VLMs can genuinely grasp the nuanced language of cinematography and its artistic intent, moving beyond literal scene interpretation. This deep cinematographic comprehension remains significantly underexplored. Existing VLM benchmarks, while diverse [8, 21, 31, 63], typically lack the necessary focus for robust cinematographic evaluation, a gap exacerbated by a scarcity of specialized models, datasets with rich cinematic annotations, and consequently, rigorous benchmarks for this specific type of understanding.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce ShotBench , a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess VLMs' understanding of cinematic language. ShotBench comprises over 3.5k

expert-annotated multiple-choice QA examples, meticulously curated from both images and video clips across over 200 films, predominantly those that have received Oscar nominations for Best Cinematography 1 . It rigorously spans eight fundamental cinematography dimensions: shot size , shot framing , camera angle , lens size , lighting type , lighting condition , composition , and camera movement . Our rigorous annotation pipeline, combining trained annotators with expert oversight, ensures a high-quality evaluation set grounded in professional cinematic knowledge.

We conduct an extensive evaluation of 24 leading open-source and proprietary VLMs on ShotBench. Our results reveal that even the strongest VLM (GPT-4o [38]) in our evaluation averages below 60% accuracy, clearly indicating a considerable gap between current VLM capabilities and genuine cinematographic comprehension. In-depth analysis further highlights specific weaknesses: advanced models such as GPT-4o [38] and Qwen2.5-VL [3], despite grasping core cinematic concepts, often struggle to map subtle visual details to precise professional terminology (e.g., distinguishing a medium shot from a medium close-up ). They also demonstrate constrained spatial reasoning, especially regarding camera position and angle. Strikingly, the camera movement dimension proved exceptionally challenging, with over half of the models failing to surpass 40% accuracy.

To further advance cinematography understanding in VLMs, we construct ShotQA , the first largescale multimodal dataset for cinematic language understanding, consisting of approximately 70k high-quality QA pairs derived from movie images and video clips. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop ShotVL , an optimized VLM series based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B [3], trained with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [46] to enhance its alignment of visual features with cinematography knowledge and strengthen its reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that ShotVL achieves consistent and substantial improvements across all ShotBench dimensions, establishing new state-of-the-art performance and decisively surpassing both the best-performing open-source (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct [3]) and proprietary (GPT-4o [38]) models.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

- We introduce ShotBench , a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' understanding of cinematic language. It comprises over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs derived from images and video clips of over 200 critically acclaimed films (predominantly Oscar-nominated), covering eight distinct cinematography dimensions. This provides a rigorous new standard for assessing fine-grained visual comprehension in film.

- We conducted an extensive evaluation of 24 leading VLMs, including prominent open-source and proprietary models, on ShotBench. Our results reveal a critical performance gap: even the most capable model, GPT-4o, achieves less than 60% average accuracy. This systematically quantifies the current limitations of VLMs in genuine cinematographic comprehension.
- To address the identified limitations and facilitate future research, we constructed ShotQA , the first large-scale multimodal dataset for cinematography understanding, containing approximately 70k high-quality QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we developed ShotVL , a novel VLM series trained using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). ShotVL significantly surpasses all tested open-source and proprietary models, establishing a new state-of-the-art on ShotBench.

## 2 Related Work

## 2.1 Benchmarking Vision-Language Models

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) [3, 26, 33, 35, 48, 61, 65] are large-scale models designed to integrate visual perception with natural language understanding. In recent years, VLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities across perception, reasoning, and a wide range of multi-disciplinary applications [1, 15, 27, 30, 31, 34, 49, 56, 57]. Recently, researchers have proposed a variety of benchmarks to assess VLMs' capability. For example, MMBench [31] evaluates VLMs across 20 distinct ability dimensions, and MMVU [63] focuses on video understanding across four core academic disciplines. Other benchmarks target specific cognitive or reasoning capacities: LogicVista [54] assesses visual logical reasoning in a multi-choice format, and SPACE [41] systematically compare spatial reasoning abilities between VLMs and animals. Additional efforts, EgoSchema [37], and VSI-Bench [55], evaluate egocentric video understanding. Moreover, some works introduce tasks with specific domains, such as scientific and mathematical figure interpretation [44, 53], knowledge acquisition [21], and visual coding [60].

## 2.2 Cinematography Understanding

Early work on automatic film analysis includes many sub-tasks such as shot type classification [42], scene segmentation [43, 47, 58], and cut type recognition [39]. For example, MovieShots [42] categories shots into five scale types and four camera movements types, providing an early taxonomy for cinematography understanding. With the rapid progress in image and video generation, film-level generation has begun to attract increasing attention [11, 23, 24, 40, 59]. Many recent works rely on VLMs to synthesise large training corpora [23, 59]. However, they often introduce additional classifiers to identify camera movements or shot sizes. For example, HunyuanVideo [23] trains a camera movement classifier capable of predicting 14 distinct camera movement types, introducing additional training and data annotation overhead.

## 3 ShotBench

To evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on cinematography understanding, we first define the concept of cinematography understanding and introduce ShotBench in 3.1. Next, we provide a detailed description of the data collection process in 3.2. Using ShotBench, we then perform evaluations to assess whether VLMs can effectively comprehend cinematic conventions and analyze potential causes of their performance limitations in 3.3.

## 3.1 Overview

Figure 2: An overview of the ShotBench construction pipeline.

<!-- image -->

Understanding cinematography involves not only identifying visual elements like framing, lighting, and camera movement, but also interpreting how they work together to convey narrative and mood. While recent VLMs show some ability to recognize cinematic language, their deeper understanding of cinematic conventions remains underexplored. Here, we introduce ShotBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' understanding of cinematography language in a comprehensive and structured manner. ShotBench covers eight core dimensions 2 commonly used in cinematic analysis: shot size , shot framing , camera angle , lens size , lighting type , lighting conditions , composition , and camera movement . These dimensions reflect key principles of visual storytelling in film production and serve as the foundation for evaluating model comprehension.

Each sample in ShotBench is paired with a multiple-choice question targeting a specific cinematography aspect, requiring the model to not only perceive the scene holistically, but also extract fine-grained visual cues to reason about the underlying cinematic techniques. An overview of the benchmark framework is illustrated in Figure 1.

## 3.2 Data Construction Process

To construct ShotBench, we design a systematic data collection and processing pipeline, as illustrated in Figure 2. The process consists of four key stages: Data Curation &amp; Pre-processing, Annotator Training, QA Annotation, and Verification.

Data Curation &amp; Pre-processing We collect the dataset primarily from films that won or were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, ensuring high-quality and professionally crafted shot. Data are sourced from public websites and include high-resolution images and video clips. To ensure quality and safety, we apply the LAION aesthetic predictor [25] for filtering lowquality samples, NSFW detection [50] to remove inappropriate content, and FFmpeg [18] to crop black bars. For video processing, we use TransNetV2 [47] to segment footage into individual shots. The full list of collected movies is provided in Appendix C.

Annotator Training To ensure high-quality annotations, we first curated comprehensive reference materials from publicly available cinematography tutorials covering all eight dimensions in ShotBench. Annotators were required to study these materials before labeling. We then conducted multi-round pilot annotations, supported by expert audits and daily discussions to resolve ambiguities. All issues and resolutions were documented to guide the final annotation phase.

QAAnnotation Based on ShotBench's predefined dimensions, we automatically generated question prompts using templated formats (e.g., "What is the shot size of this movie shot?" ). Weensured an even distribution of questions across the eight dimensions, as illustrated in Appendix C (Figure 15b). For image data, we extracted candidate labels from Shotdeck 3 , a professional cinematography reference platform, where metadata had been curated by experienced photographers. Annotators verified these labels against ShotBench guidelines and corrected any discrepancies. All label modifications were reviewed by experts. For videos, annotators identified all valid camera movement intervals by marking start and end timestamps.

Verification All question-answer pairs were reviewed through multiple expert audits, with batches revised iteratively until reaching satisfactory quality. Through this rigorous pipeline, we further sampled from the validated data to construct the final benchmark, consisting of 3,049 images and

## 3.3 Evaluation

Setup To provide a comprehensive assessment of the challenges posed by ShotBench and establish reference baselines for future research, we evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models that support video or multi-image inputs. Specifically, we evaluate a total of 24 foundation models, including both open-source and proprietary models: Qwen2.5-VL [3], LLaVAVideo [62], LLaVA-OneVision [26], InternVL-2.5 &amp; 3 [7, 65], InternLM-XComposer-2.0 [14], Ovis2 [36], VILA1.5 [28], InstructBLIP [9], and Gemini-2.0 &amp; 2.5 [12, 13]. All ShotBench questions are designed as four-option single-choice questions. For questions involving multiple keywords (e.g., lighting condition), each option contains the same number of keywords to maintain balance. Only the correct option includes all the correct keywords, while the distractors may contain a mixture of correct and incorrect keywords to enhance the challenge and maintain fairness. Specifically, To ensure fairness and reproducibility, we adopt the VLMEvalKit [16] framework for standardized evaluation. We report accuracy as the primary metric to quantify model performance on ShotBench. Additional implementation details and evaluation prompts are provided in the Appendix B.

Results and Findings The evaluation results are reported in Table 2, yield several key findings: (1) Approximately half of the evaluated models attain an overall accuracy below 50%. Even the leading model, GPT-4o, fails to reach 60% accuracy, underscoring the significant gap between current VLMs and a true understanding of cinematography. (2) The overall performance differences between opensource and proprietary models are marginal. Notably, Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct (59.1%) achieves almost the same performance as GPT-4o (59.3%) (3) The camera movement dimension represents a particular area of weakness across current models, with achieved accuracy often approximating random selection (around 25%). (4) Within each series, larger models generally achieve higher accuracy (as shown in Figure 3), suggesting a potential scaling effect with respect to model size in cinematography language understanding.

To better understand the limitations of current VLMs in cinematic language understanding, we conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on the prediction results of representative models. Our analysis reveals significant challenges for current models across three core aspects: (1) fine-grained visual-terminology alignment , (2) spatial perception of camera position and orientation , and (3) visual reasoning in cinematography .

Fine-Grained Visual-Terminology Alignment Through extensive case studies, we find that current VLMs frequently fail to precisely align visual cues with specific cinematic terms, particularly when the task requires expert-level distinctions. Such shortcomings are especially evident in dimensions like shot size and lens size , where categories are defined by fine-grained framing or focal length conventions. For example, a Medium Wide Shot (MWS) typically frames the subject from

Camera Angle

the knees up, while a Medium Shot (MS) frames from the waist up. Regarding lens size , Ultra Wide offer a broader field of view and often introduce edge distortion, whereas Long Lens compress spatial depth, making the foreground and background elements appear closer. We draw the confusion matrices based on results of GPT-4o, shown in Figure 5. It reveals that most misclassifications occur between visually adjacent categories. For instance, MS is frequently confused with MCU (36.2%) or MWS (10.1%), and Medium lens is often misclassified as Wide or Long lens .

These findings suggest that current VLMs lack fine-grained alignment needed to reliably distinguish between visually similar but semantically distinct categories. A plausible explanation is that the training data used for these models may lack sufficient annotation granularity or consistency in cinematography labeling, limiting their ability to internalize professional-level distinctions.

Spatial Perception of Camera Position and Orientation ShotBench systematically evaluates this ability at the level of cinematic language, covering concepts such as camera angle, position, and focal

length changes. ShotBench evaluates both static and dynamic camera attributes. For static scenarios, models are tested on fixed-angle concepts such as low angle and high angle . For dynamic cases, the camera movement dimension probes a model's ability to recognize changes in position (e.g., pull out ), angle (e.g., tilt up ), and focal length (e.g., zoom in ). Results show that even the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves only 58.2% accuracy on static camera angle recognition, indicating its struggle in perceiving and reasoning the camera orientation in the space. The situation is worse for camera movements, where more than half of the evaluated models fall below 40% substantially lower than their performance on other ShotBench dimensions.

Our case study analysis reveals that frontier models often show solid textual understanding of camerarelated terms. However, they often fail to make correct predictions in practice. For instance, almost no existing model successfully distinguishes between position change ( push in ) and focal length change ( zoom in ), a task that requires perceiving parallax ( 6 (second row, third column). Besides, even identifying a high angle may result in incorrect predictions due to misperception of camera height and tilt (Figure 6, top row, second case), not to mention the change of orientation ( 6 (second row, third column).

Visual Reasoning in Cinematography We observe that understanding some dimensions might need VLM to reason like a cinematography expert. For example, recognizing a short side composition (Figure 6, second row, third column) requires the model to infer the subject's gaze direction relative to their frame position-a subtle yet important cue. Similarly, identifying fluorescent lighting may involve reasoning the light source based on the subject's color tone, apparent color temperature, and the direction and softness of shadows in the scene (Figure 6, second row, first column). We hypothesize that reasoning processes can help VLMs attend to critical visual details relevant to cinematic semantics-such as spatial reasoning for determining camera angle or lens size, identifying camera movement from the motion of elements within the frame, and even discerning the director's intent in guiding the viewer's attention through compositional choices. We provide quantitative and qualitative analyses in Section 5.3 and Appendix A.2. Our findings suggest that encouraging VLMs to engage in structured reasoning provides noticeable improvements in their ability to understand cinematic language.

## 4 ShotQA &amp; ShotVL: Advancing Cinematography Understanding via Targeted Training

To address the nuanced challenge of enabling Visual Language Models (VLMs) to perceive and reason about cinematic elements, we introduce ShotQA , a novel large-scale dataset, and ShotVL , a VLM series specifically designed for cinematography understanding. ShotVL employs a strategic two-stage training pipeline: initial large-scale Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) for broad knowledge

acquisition, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [46] for fine-grained reasoning refinement on a curated subset.

ShotQA: A Dedicated Dataset for Cinematography Comprehension. ShotQA stands as the first large-scale dataset meticulously designed to benchmark and enhance VLMs' grasp of cinematographic techniques. It comprises 58k images and 1.2k video clips. These resources are sourced from 243 diverse films to ensure broad coverage of cinematic styles. All samples are formatted as multi-choice QApairs, facilitating structured evaluation and targeted training. Each entry is enriched with metadata, including film title and source clip timestamp, allowing for contextual understanding. Table 9 details the sample distribution, revealing a noteworthy balance across most cinematic dimensions. The scale and specificity of ShotQA provide a critical resource for advancing research in this domain.

Stage 1: Large-scale Supervised Fine-tuning for Foundational Alignment. In the foundational first stage, ShotVL undergoes SFT using approximately 70k QA pairs sampled from the ShotQA dataset. We utilize Qwen-2.5-VL-3B-Instruct [3] as the base model. The model processes an image or video alongside a question and multiple-choice options, and is trained to directly predict the correct answer via a cross-entropy loss. This SFT phase is crucial for establishing a strong alignment between visual features and specific cinematic terminology, equipping the model with a broad understanding of cinematographic concepts.

Stage 2: Reinforcement Learning with GRPO for Enhanced Reasoning. Building upon the SFTinitialized model, the second stage employs GRPO to further elevate ShotVL's reasoning capabilities and prediction accuracy.

Given a multimodal input x (an image/video and textual query), GRPO generates G distinct responses { o 1 , . . . , o G } from the current policy π θ old . These are evaluated using a rule-based binary reward function, inspired by prior work [20, 32, 51]:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Following DeepSeek-R1 [20], our reward incorporates two components: (1) a format reward to ensure outputs adhere to a structured pattern ( &lt;think&gt;...&lt;/think&gt; and &lt;answer&gt;...&lt;/answer&gt; tags), and (2) an accuracy reward comparing the extracted answer from the &lt;answer&gt; block with the ground truth.

The advantage A i for the i -th response is calculated by normalizing its reward within the group:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

(where δ is a small constant for numerical stability, e.g., 1 e -8 ).

Finally, GRPO optimizes the policy π θ by maximizing the objective:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Here, ϵ is a hyperparameter controlling the policy update step size, and the clipping mechanism stabilizes training. For this RL phase, we utilize a focused subset of approximately 8k high-quality multiple-choice QA instances from ShotQA to refine the model's ability to select the correct option with higher confidence and precision.

## 5 Experiments

## 5.1 Implementation Details

Our implementation is based on ms-swift [64]. We initialize Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct [3] as our base model. We use around 60k samples for SFT and approximately 8k samples for GRPO. We use Flash Attention-2 [10] as the model's attention implementation and bfloat16 precision for both training and inference to reduce memory consumption. In SFT stage, the global batch size is set to 4, and the model is trained for 1 epoch with a learning rate of 1e-5. In GRPO stage, we set the group size G to 12 and the global batch size to 24. The clipping parameter ϵ is set to 0.2. The model is trained for 10 epochs with a learning rate of 1 × 10 -6 . Detailed hyper-parameters are provided in the Appendix B.

For comparison, we include results from the strongest open-source model (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) and the leading proprietary model (GPT-4o) from Table 2, alongside the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-3BInstruct, as reported in Table 3. Compared to the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, Shot-VL (3B) achieves substantial improvements across all dimensions, with an average gain of 19.0 points, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset and training methodology. Furthermore, despite having only 3B parameters, our model surpasses both GPT-4o and the strongest open-source model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, setting a new state of the art in cinematography language understanding while offering significantly lower deployment and usage costs. We further conduct experiments on the 7B variant of our model and observed even stronger performance, which reinforces the robustness of our dataset and training strategy. We present further experiments and analysis in the following section, with visualizations of representative model outputs included in the Appendix A.2.

## 5.3 Ablation Study

In this section, we investigate the effectiveness of ShotVL's two-stage training strategy. In particular, we compare five training strategies: SFT, CoT-SFT, GRPO, SFT → GRPO, and CoT-SFT → GRPO. For fast exploration, we sample approximately 4k images for the SFT stage and around 1k for GRPO. Besides, we reduce the batch size for SFT to 2, and set the group size and batch size for GRPO to 6. The number of training epochs for GRPO is also reduced to 5, while all other settings remain unchanged. To generate reasoning process for CoT-SFT, we first construct a JSON-formatted knowledge base containing definitions and identification methods for all cinematic terms covered in ShotBench. For each training sample, we retrieve the relevant entries corresponding to the question and candidate choices from the knowledge base, and prompt Gemini-2.0-flash to produce reasoning process grounded in cinematic knowledge. More details of the knowledge base are provided in the Appendix B.

We report the performance of each training method in Table 4. It is observed that all training strategies yield notable improvements over the baseline, demonstrating the high quality and effectiveness of our constructed dataset. Comparing SFT with CoT-SFT, we find that the latter yields very small gains. This may be due to the low quality of reasoning chains generated by Gemini-2.0-flash, which fail to provide effective supervision and may introduce noise. This further highlights the advantage of GRPO, which focuses solely on outcome reward supervision.

Another observation is that reasoning-augmented training consistently improves performance in the camera movement dimension (ranging from +0.4% to +4.6%), despite the ablation experiments being conducted solely on static images and containing no camera movement related questions. This may indicate that reasoning chain generation may implicitly enhance VLMs' capability to recognize dynamic motion. From Figure 7, GRPO consistently improves performance across most dimensions

under all training settings. Among all configurations, the SFT → GRPO setup achieves the best overall performance, confirming its effectiveness for enhancing cinematography understanding. More case studies are provided in Appendix A.2.

## 6 Conclusion

In this work, we introduce ShotBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on cinematography understanding. Through extensive evaluations, we identify notable limitations in current VLMs' capabilities. To tackle these problems, we construct ShotQA, the first large-scale dataset dedicated to this area. We propose ShotVL series with SFT and GRPO training, successfully enhancing the model's (Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) capability and achieving new state-of-the-art performance. We hope our work will contribute to future progress in image/video understanding and generation.

## A Discussions

## A.1 Limitations

(1) Both ShotBench and ShotQA are constructed from real-world movie data. However, cinematic shots are not always with standard and clearly defined terminology. Besides, the data distribution is imbalanced across some dimensions (e.g., camera movements like dolly zoom is rare in real data). Moreover, high-quality video annotation is labor-intensive. To improve scalability, future work may explore synthetic data for more robust performance.

(2) We primarily validate the effectiveness of our dataset and training approach using Qwen2.5-VL3B-Instruct, which has limited capability due to a relatively fewer parameters. Further studies may focus on larger base model to further improve performance.

## A.2 ShotVL: Reasoning Like a Cinematographer

ShotVL Beats GPT-4o Our experimental results show that our model outperforms previous SOTA GPT-4o, we visualize some cases and compare the outputs between ShotVL and GPT-4o in Figure 8.

Figure 8: Comparison between GPT-4o and ShotVL.

Reasoning process improves performance As illustrated in Figure 9, the average reward increases throughout the GRPO process, indicating that the generation of resoning process helps ShotVL to better understand and recognize cinematic language within a movie shot. More intuitively, we visualize the outputs between ShotVL and the pure SFT variant in Figure 10.

## A.3 Current VLMs' Cinematography Understanding Needs Further Enhancement

We further visualize failure cases from the strongest open-source model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct , as well as the strongest proprietary model, GPT-4o , as shown in Figure 11.

## A.4 More Visualizations

More output cases with thinking process from ShotVL are provided in Figure 12.

## B Implementation Details for Evaluation and Experiments

Details of Evaluation During evaluation, we first attempt to extract each model's final answer using template-based matching. If no valid match is found, we follow the previous works [31, 63] to use GPT-4o as an automatic answer extractor. For open-source models, we densely sample video frames at 12 FPS with a maximum resolution of 360×640 pixels. For image-based samples, we follow the default input configurations of each model. We apply greedy decoding during inference for reproducibility. For proprietary models, we evaluate them via their official APIs, setting the temperature to 0 to produce deterministic outputs. We use GPT-4o (2024-08-06) to extract final answers, based on the prompt in Figure 13.

Details of Experiments Our training implementation is based on ms-swift framework [64]. All hyper-parameters we use for the main experiments are reported in Table 5 and Table 6. The training process of SFT is performed on 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs and the GRPO process is performed on 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs.

In our ablation study, we construct a JSON formatted knowledge base on cinematography and use it to prompt Gemini-2.0-flash to generate reasoning process. We visualize some examples in Figure 14.

An overview of cinematic terms used in ShotBench and the distribution of QA pairs are visualized in Figure 15a and Figure 15b. Details of ShotBench are provided in Table 8. We adopted an aesthetic score threshold of 3.0, samples with low aesthetic scores often characterized by poor composition, motion blur, or chaotic visual content. Such samples typically lack well-defined cinematic attributes and were excluded to maintain the overall quality of our dataset. And a total of 20 trained annotators participated in the annotation process during dataset construction.

More details of ShotQA ShotQA is constructed in a similar manner to ShotBench (Section 3.2), except that only video samples are totally manually annotated and verified by trained annotators and experts. For large-scale image annotations sourced from expert cinematography websites, we conducted random sampling checks and found their quality adequate for training use. We adopt a two-stage filtering strategy to ensure no overlap between training and evaluation sets: we first remove duplicate samples based on IMDb IDs and timestamp as a coarse-level filtering step. Then, we extract CLIP features for all samples and exclude samples from the training set whose feature has a cosine similarity greater than 0.95 (following [5, 6, 19]) with any sample in ShotBench.

The GRPO sub-dataset consists of a combination of mid-difficulty samples and uniformly sampled QA pairs across all eight dimensions. We identify mid-difficulty samples by prompting Qwen2.5VL-3B to answer a subset of the data multiple times and selecting those for which both correct and incorrect answers are observed across different runs. The remaining QA pairs were uniformly sampled again and used for SFT.

## E Societal Impact Statement

This work presents ShotBench, a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on cinematic language understanding, and ShotQA, a large-scale dataset designed for training such capabilities. Additionally, we propose ShotVL, a reasoning-enhanced VLM series trained via SFT and GRPO.

Positive Societal Impact. By improving VLMs' understanding of professional cinematic conventions, our work can contribute to the development of AI systems that assist in film production. Specifically, cinematography-aware models may support AI-assisted filmmaking tasks such as shot planning, automated style matching, and film-level image/video generation. These capabilities could help democratize access to professional filmmaking workflows, reduce production costs, and empower creators with limited resources. In addition, our benchmark and dataset may foster research into multimodal reasoning, benefiting broader applications in video understanding and generation.

Negative Societal Impact. As with other generative or vision-language technologies, there are potential negative applications. For example:

Disinformation and deepfakes: Enhanced understanding of cinematic language could be exploited to make AI-generated fake content more visually convincing or emotionally manipulative.

Creative job displacement: The use of cinematography-aware models in automated filmmaking pipelines may marginalize certain creative roles (e.g., assistant editors, junior cinematographers).

Bias propagation: If the training data or annotations reflect specific cultural aesthetics or norms (e.g., Western cinematic styles), the resulting models may encode biased visual preferences or overlook underrepresented filmmaking traditions.

## NeurIPS Paper Checklist

## 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our contributions are summarized in both abstract and introduction 1.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

## 2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Limitations are discussed in Appendix A.1.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

## 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we propose assumptions based on the findings in Section 3.3, and prove our assumptions through experiments in Section 5

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

## 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Details of our experiments are reported in Appendix B.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

## 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We will opensource dataset, codes and models, as mentioned in Section 1. Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so 'No' is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

## 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Hyper-parameters for evaluation and training are detailed in Appendix B Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

## 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: The experimental results of VLMs are basically consistent when the hyperparameters are fixed, and repeating the experiments requires a significant amount of computing resources.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
- The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
- The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

- It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

## 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Information of computer resources needed is reported in Appendix B.

## Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

## 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper is conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

## 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the positive impacts and negative impacts in Appendix E. Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
- Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

- The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

## 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We release ShotBench and ShotQA under a non-commercial research license. All movie data are obtained from publicly available sources, and we filter out inappropriate content using automated tools (e.g., NSFW detectors). Additionally, we include metadata for source traceability and clearly document intended use cases to discourage misuse. The trained model series ShotVL will be released under gated access and subject to terms of responsible use.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

## 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use publicly available assets with proper attribution and license compliance. All third-party tools or models are cited in the main text or Appendix, with license names and official links included when available.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
- The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
- The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
- The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
- For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

- If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
- For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
- If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

## 13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Details of our new dataset and benchmark are provided in Appendix C Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

## 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [No]

Justification: This work does not involve crowdsourcing or experiments with human subjects in the traditional academic sense. The data annotation was carried out by a third-party professional data service provider. Annotators were paid according to the service agreement, and we ensured they had access to comprehensive publicly available cinematography reference materials, which we include in Appendix D. However, since the annotation was conducted externally and not through a controlled experimental setup, we do not include internal instructions or screenshots.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

## 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [No]

Justification: The annotations used in this study were conducted by a professional third-party annotation company. Our team did not interact directly with annotators or collect any personal or sensitive information. Therefore, this study does not involve human subjects research under the definition requiring IRB or equivalent approval.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
- We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
- For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

## 16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We used Gemini-2.0-flash to generate reasoning chains grounded in a structured cinematography knowledge base as part of our ablation study (Section 5.3). Our model was initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.
- Please refer to our LLM policy ( https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM ) for what should or should not be described.
