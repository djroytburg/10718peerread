## Abstract

Recent studies have shown that making a model spend more time thinking through longer Chain of Thoughts (CoTs) enables it to gain significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks. While current researches continue to explore the benefits of increasing test-time compute by extending the CoT lengths of Large Language Models (LLMs), we are concerned about a potential issue hidden behind the current pursuit of test-time scaling: Would excessively scaling the CoT length actually bring adverse effects to a model's reasoning performance? Our explorations on mathematical reasoning tasks reveal an unexpected finding that scaling with longer CoTs can indeed impair the reasoning performance of LLMs in certain domains. Moreover, we discover that there exists an optimal scaled length distribution that differs across different domains. Based on these insights, we propose a ThinkingOptimal Scaling strategy. Our method first uses a small set of seed data with varying response length distributions to teach the model to adopt different reasoning efforts for deep thinking. Then, the model selects its shortest correct response under different reasoning efforts on additional problems for self-improvement. Our self-improved models built upon Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct outperform other distillation-based 32B o1-like models across various math benchmarks, and achieve performance on par with the teacher model QwQ-32B-Preview that produces the seed data. 3

## 1 Introduction

Recently, System-2 thinking [44] has become an important research area for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike previous System-1 thinking systems [45, 35] that perform fast thinking, such a slow thinking system aims to increase the test-time compute of LLMs to make them think more thoroughly before responding to a question. OpenAI' o1 model [28] has demonstrated a promising potential in this direction. By incentivizing the model to employ longer internal Chain of Thoughts (CoTs) [42] for thinking, o1 shows human-like reasoning capabilities, including searching, reflecting, backtracking, and re-exploring in its reasoning process, and achieves outstanding performance on complex reasoning tasks [13, 33].

Subsequently, a series of follow-up studies [30, 36, 11] have been proposed to imitate and explore o1-like thinking systems. These studies try to scale the number of reasoning tokens of LLMs either by distilling from existing o1-like models [14, 25, 26] or reinforcement learning [6, 15], and gain significant improvements compared to earlier reasoning models [45, 35].

Behind the promising paradigm of test-time scaling, there is a few concurrent studies [3, 22] highlighting an efficiency issue of overthinking in existing o1-like models, where they tend to generate an excessive number of tokens, even for simple questions that could be answered correctly with just a few tokens. However, we are concerned about a more critical issue that could the excessive pursuit of longer CoTs have negative impacts on the model's reasoning performance? That is, besides the efficiency issues, we aim to explore and study whether and how overly test-time scaling could potentially impair the reasoning performance of LLMs, typically in the math domain.

To study the problem, we first calculate and compare the accuracies and used reasoning tokens of several o1-like models and their corresponding System-1 thinking models on MATH500 [20] and AIME2024 4 (see Figure 1). We find that subsequent o1-like models, QwQ-32B-Preview [30] as an typical example, generate much more tokens but gain only limited improvements in model performance. This preliminary exploration indicates that scaling to more reasoning tokens might not consistently lead to better performance. Then, to fairly investigate the performance comparison of the same base model after scaling with different lengths of CoTs, we conduct additional experiments on LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct [24] and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct [29]. Specifically, we utilize QwQ-32BPreview [30] to generate and filter three types of reasoning paths with different lengths for the same set of prompts. Then, we teach the base model to use different reasoning efforts (i.e., different numbers of reasoning tokens) to solve a given problem based on learning on different subsets. Surprisingly, we find that training with longer reasoning paths leads to worse performance especially in easier tasks, and there exists an optimal reasoning effort that varies across tasks of different difficulty levels. Our further analysis reveals that longer CoTs may contain more erroneous steps. Though including a certain incorrect steps and subsequent reflective steps can teach the model how to correct errors in inference, training on excessive erroneous steps can have a negative impact.

Based on the above findings, we propose a Thinking-OPtimal Scaling strategy (TOPS) that allows LLMs to decide by themselves how many tokens are needed to solve a given problem. The motivation is, if an LLM can already answer a question correctly under the given reasoning effort, increasing the response length with additional tokens may have adverse effects as longer responses are more likely to include erroneous steps. On the other hand, encouraging LLMs to spend more time thinking brings benefits to tackling more challenging problems. Therefore, we first use a small set of o1-like responses under different reasoning efforts (i.e., of varying lengths) to train a 'tag' model, which is used to generate responses for a large set of math problems under different reasoning efforts. Then, we select the shortest correct response generated across all reasoning efforts given the same problem to create a thinking-optimal dataset, which is used for the self-improvement of the base model. Our self-improved model based on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct achieves better performance than existing distillation-based 32B o1-like models in various benchmarks with varying levels of difficulty, including GSM8K [4], MATH500 and AIME2024. Furthermore, we perform iterative self-improvement and obtain a reasoning model that achieves comparable performance to QwQ-32BPreview.

LLM Reasoning Leveraging the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique [42, 51], LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance on various reasoning tasks [34, 33, 35]. CoT enables LLMs to decompose the entire problem into several sub-goals and then reason step-by-step to achieve a more reliable answer. Among various LLM reasoning tasks, mathematical reasoning has become one of the most widely studied and important tasks. Current work on LLM math reasoning primarily focuses on: synthesizing large-scale and diverse math data [49, 48, 17], constructing challenging math reasoning benchmarks [8, 9], training powerful process reward models (PRMs) [20, 39, 36], and designing more effective algorithms to improve math reasoning capabilities of LLMs [16, 12, 5].

Test-Time Scaling Recently, scaling test-time compute of LLMs has shown significant potential for further improving their reasoning performance [1, 2]. Existing test-time scaling studies can be divided into several categories: (1) Sampling-based scaling aims to increase the number of individual reasoning paths of LLMs when solving a given problem. Then the most reliable answer is selected from all the generated options using mechanisms such as majority voting [40], weighted majority voting [18], or best-of-N selection [20]. (2) Tree search-based scaling expands reasoning paths by

constructing tree-like trajectories, allowing LLMs to explore diverse options at each state and continue reasoning along the most promising directions. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) [47] and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) [43, 50, 37, 52] are two typical tree search-based test-time scaling methods. (3) In-context search-based scaling enables LLMs to learn to search, backtrack and re-explore within one single CoT path [7]. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model [28] have made a significant breakthrough in this line. It leverages reinforcement learning to scale the lengths of CoT to enable LLMs to perform thorough thinking through reflection, verification and re-exploration when solving problems. Following the same line, a series of studies [36, 6, 30, 11, 25, 14, 19, 46] have been proposed to scale CoT lengths during inference time. Our work also primarily focuses on the scaling properties of o1-like models.

We notice that there is a few concurrent studies [3, 22] highlighting that existing o1-like models exhibit overthinking issues, often generating an excessive number of tokens for simple problems with minimal benefit. Thus, they aim to shorten the CoT lengths of o1-like models while preserving their performance. However, our work differs in that we aim to uncover a deeper and more critical issue: scaling with more tokens can, in some cases, even degrade the model's performance. Thus, our work focuses on achieving optimal test-time scaling from base models in both aspects of effectiveness and efficiency.

## 3 The impact of scaling efforts on the effectiveness of test-time scaling

## 3.1 Preliminary analysis on existing o1-like models

Though o1-like models has proven to be much more effective on reasoning tasks than previous System1 thinking models, we are curious about the scaling process behind the these o1-like models. That is, we want to explore that: How effective has their scaling achieved compared to their corresponding System-1 thinking models(e.g., QwQ-32B-Preview v.s. Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct)?

We first conduct a preliminary analysis on several existing typical o1-like models along with their corresponding System-1 thinking models. Specifically, we choose o1-mini [28] v.s. gpt-4o/4omini [27], 5 Gemini2.0-Flash-Thinking-Exp.-1219 [11] v.s. Gemini2.0-Flash-Exp. [10], QwQ-32BPreview [30] v.s. Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct [29], and DeepSeek-R1 [6] v.s. DeepSeek-V3 [21] as our experimental models. We calculate the accuracy and the average number of generated tokens of each model on two typical benchmarks: MATH500 [20]: 500 high school math competition problems across various subjects, sampled from MATH benchmark [13]; AIME2024 : 30 challenging problems from the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME). To address the issue of token counts not being directly comparable due to the different tokenizers used by different models, we standardize by using Qwen2.5 tokenizer to tokenize the reasoning completions of different models

5 Note that o1-mini and 4o/4o-mini do not have equivalent number of parameters, but we make a rough comparison here.

Table 1: Data statistics (number of problems and average number of tokens in responses for each type of reasoning effort) of three types of data samples under different reasoning efforts for training each tag model.

| Model           | #Problems   | #Tokens   | #Tokens   | #Tokens   |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|                 |             | Low       | Medium    | High      |
| LLaMA3.1-8B-Tag | 1256        | 1532.32   | 2460.07   | 3647.50   |
| Qwen2.5-32B-Tag | 1312        | 1588.23   | 2535.65   | 3767.92   |

and then calculate the number of tokens. As the internal CoT of o1-mini is not available to users, we use an estimation strategy based on the summary part, the number of reasoning tokens and total number of completion tokens returned from the o1-mini model to estimate the number of tokens of hidden CoT tokenized by Qwen2.5 tokenizer. Details and further discussions are in Appendix B. We set the maximum number of generation tokens to 16,384 for each model in all evaluations.

We put the visualization results in Figure 1. As we can see, subsequent o1-like models (QwQ32B-Preview and Gemini2.0-Flash-Thinking) show less effective scaling effects compared with o1-mini, as they generate much more tokens but gain less improvements when scaling from their corresponding System-1 thinking models. QwQ-32B-Preview has the most severe issue in this regard. This preliminary analysis suggests, to some extent, that excessively scaling to longer CoTs does not maximize test-time scaling effects.

## 3.2 Deeper explorations on the scaling process of CoT length

The above analysis still faces a problem that the base models of different o1-like models are not identical, making it unfairly to compare the impacts of scaled CoT lengths on test-time scaling effects of different models. Therefore, we conduct experiments on LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct [24] and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct [29] to fairly investigate the impact of the scaling efforts on the effectiveness of test-time scaling. Specifically, we first use three system prompts (refer to Figure 7), corresponding to different levels of reasoning effort ('Low', 'Medium' and 'High'), to prompt QwQ-32B-Preview to generate solutions of different numbers of tokens for the same set of math problems sampled from NuminaMath [17]. We then filter out the problems that can be answered correctly under all three reasoning efforts, along with the corresponding three reasoning paths of different lengths. However, we find that QwQ-32B-Preview has relatively poor instruction-following abilities, reflected in that the length distributions of the generated responses for the same question does not closely match the specified system prompts (refer to the empirical evidence in Appendix G). Therefore, for a given problem, we further reorder the three responses based on their lengths and keep them if their pairwise length difference consistently exceeds 300 tokens. The length is determined either by LLaMA3.1 tokenizer or Qwen2.5 tokenizer depending on the chosen experimental model. Finally, we curate a set of 1.3K problems, each accompanied by three o1-like responses of varying lengths. The data statistics of each set for each model is shown in Table 1. We assign different system prompts (the same in Figure 7) to each type of responses and train the base model on all three types of samples. By doing so, we ensure the consistency between the base model and the training problems, allowing for a fair comparison on the impacts of different scaling efforts on the effectiveness of test-time scaling. We refer to the fine-tuned model as the 'tag' model (LLaMA3.1-8B-Tag and Qwen2.5-32B-Tag). During inference, we can use different system prompts to guide the tag model in applying varying levels of reasoning effort to answer the questions.

The detailed training settings are put in Appendix E.1. For evaluation, besides MATH500 and AIME2024 introduced before, we further include GSM8K [4] that contains 1319 grade school math word problems. In the following, unless otherwise specified, we set the decoding temperature to 1.0 for all o1-like models, by following the recommended setting for o1 model. 6 For System-1 thinking models LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we report the results for both decoding temperatures with 1.0 and 0.0 for comprehensive comparison. Each result under 1.0 temperature is averaged over 5 random seeds. The full results on LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively. We also display the performance of QwQ-32B-

Preview on all evaluation benchmarks when directly prompted with different prompts in Appendix H for reference. We can draw several interesting conclusions from these results: (1) A small number o1-like responses is already highly effective in enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs. This is also consistent with the previous findings [25, 14]. (2) Scaling with longer CoTs can bring negative effects to the model's reasoning performance in certain domains , especially on easy tasks. For example, both LLaMA3.1-8B-Tag and Qwen2.5-32B-Tag perform worse under high reasoning effort compared to the other two reasoning efforts, while consuming significantly more tokens, particularly on GSM8K and MATH500. (3) There exists an optimal reasoning efforts that varies across different tasks of varying difficulty levels. As we can see, low reasoning effort consistently works best on GSM8K, while medium and high reasoning efforts are more beneficial for harder question. Furthermore, we display the breakdown results of each model on MATH500 categorized by different problem levels in Appendix F, and the results also show the consistent conclusions on the negative effect of excessively scaling CoT lengths. We also conduct additional experiments on general reasoning tasks beyond mathematical reasoning to demonstrate that the above findings hold true in other tasks as well. The detailed results and discussions are in Appendix J.

To further investigate the impact of scaling with varying CoT length distributions, we calculate the distributions of answers of reasoning effort-conditioned models under different reasoning efforts. Specifically, we calculate the average number of distinct answers in 5 samples per prompt under each reasoning effort. The results are in Table 2. We also display the accuracy on each benchmark for reference. We find a very interesting phenomenon. Generally, the reasoning effort that achieves the best performance on a certain benchmark also leads to the lowest average number of distinct answers per prompt. This indicates that, under the optimal thinking effort, the model can generate the most consistent answers across multiple samplings without either underthinking or overthinking .

## 3.3 Analysis on the adverse effects of excessive length scaling

Here, we take a deeper step to explore why training on longer CoTs leads to a decline in model's reasoning performance. We randomly selected 100 problems from the tag model's training set along

with their responses under three different reasoning efforts. We first follow the existing study [3] to use gpt-4o to determine the total number of reasoning rounds contained in each response. Each reasoning round is defined as a complete reasoning process or verification process that contains a final answer. Besides, we further use gpt-4o to determine the number of reasoning rounds that contain erroneous steps or wrong final answers. The utilized prompt is shown in Appendix D. We visualize the average number of reasoning rounds, the average number of erroneous reasoning rounds, and the average ratio of erroneous reasoning rounds, on each problem under each reasoning effort in Figure 4. Note that all evaluated responses have correct final answers.

First, we can see that the number of reasoning rounds consistently increases from low reasoning effort to high reasoning effort. It could lead to the overthinking issue in reasoning models [3], where redundant tokens are used to answer the question through repetitive verification. This, however, should not affect the accuracy if all reasoning rounds are correct. Unfortunately, we observe a pattern that the number and proportion of erroneous reasoning rounds also increase when the reasoning effort becomes higher . Training the model on more wrong steps would bring adverse effects to the model's reasoning abilities, which can explain why scaling with high reasoning effort leads to worse results. Therefore, we can conclude that while including a certain incorrect and reflective steps can help the model learn to correct errors during inference, an excess of erroneous steps can have a detrimental impact on model's learning.

To further validate the above claim, we conduct controlled validation experiments about training the model on erroneous reasoning steps with subsequent error corrections. Specifically, we first construct long CoTs with reflection and correction from scratch. We obtain initial CoTs with incorrect answers generated by LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on MATH training prompts, and use Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to critique them (i.e., identify the erroneous step and generate suggestions for correction). Then, we enable LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct to generate self-reflections and corrections based on the critiques, and

Our method includes three stages: Format Imitation enables the base model to learn how to adopt different levels of reasoning effort e i to perform System-2 thinking, using a small set of seed data. Reasoning Effort-Conditioned Generation requires the model to apply System-2 thinking to a large set of problems under different reasoning efforts. Self-Improvement select the shortest correct response for each problem among all responses to fine-tune the base model to achieve thinking-optimal test-time scaling.

merge these with the initial responses to form long CoTs. We fine-tune LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on the created long CoTs. In the results shown in Figure 5, we can observe that if we apply loss masking to the tokens in the identified wrong steps (i.e., not calculating loss on these erroneous steps), the performance is better compared to calculating loss on all steps/tokens . This further validates our claim that training on erroneous steps can negatively impact model performance. Additional experiments and empirical analysis are in Appendix I.

## 4 Thinking-optimal test-time scaling

The above analysis reveals that excessively increasing the response lengths of LLMs can result in negative consequences. This motivates us that an optimal approach to achieve test-time scaling is allowing the model to determine by itself the number of tokens needed to solve each problem. Specifically, for a simple question, if the model can provide a correct answer within a certain number of tokens, further extending the CoTs becomes suboptimal, as it may introduce unnecessary overthinking or even additional erroneous steps into the reasoning process. Conversely, the model should be encouraged to use more tokens for difficult problems if additional reasoning effort can help it to obtain a more reliable and accurate answer.

Thus, we propose a Thinking-OPtimal Scaling ( TOPS ) strategy aiming to achieve more effective and efficient test-time scaling for LLM reasoning. We define a System-2 thinking-optimal response as the shortest correct response that the model can generate using System-2 thinking : fewer tokens may lead to wrong answer while more tokens causes overthinking. Then, our method includes three stages: Format Imitation, Reasoning Effort-Conditioned Generation, and Self-Improvement. The illustration of our method is shown in Figure 6.

Format Imitation First, we require a small set of o1-like responses for a cold start, enabling the model to learn the format of System-2 thinking patterns, including searching, reflecting, verification, backtracking, etc. Preliminary results in Section 3.2 and previous studies [25, 14] have shown that a small number of o1-like responses are sufficient for the model to effectively learn the format of System-2 reasoning. Such a small set of seed data can be manually human-written or generated by existing o1-like models. However, different from previous studies [25, 26] that use a fixed length distribution of seed samples (i.e., directly generated by existing o1-like models), which may not be a thinking-optimal distribution for our base model, we instead create the seed data containing responses under different reasoning efforts (i.e., different length distributions). Specifically, we define a small number of seed problems as P s , and our goal is to curate a seed dataset D s = D s 1 ∪ · · · ∪ D s n , where D s i = { ( e i , x, y e i ) | x ∼ P s } represents the responses to seed problems under a specific

reasoning effort e i . This follows the same procedure as data curation for the tag model in Section 3.2. Then, we train the base model on this dataset to obtain the tag model that can apply different levels of reasoning effort to perform System-2 thinking on a given problem:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Reasoning Effort-Conditioned Generation We then use the tag model to generate the solutions on a large number of additional math problems P a under different reasoning efforts e i :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where π ( ·| θ tag ) denotes the output distribution of the tag model. We select the shortest correct solution y sc among all generations { y e 1 , · · · , y e n } as the thinking-optimal response for problem x , and obtain a thinking-optimal self-improvement dataset D TOP = { ( x, y sc ) | x ∼ P a ) } .

Self-Improvement After obtaining the thinking-optimal dataset determined by the model itself, we can use it to train the base model, enabling the base model to achieve better self-improvement on System-2 thinking. Specifically, we perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the base model on D TOP :

## 5 Experiments and analysis

## 5.1 Experimental settings

Base Model We mainly display and compare the results of performing Thinking-Optimal Scaling on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, as it serves as an appropriate base model for exploration on test-time scaling according to previous works [30, 25, 26]. To validate the generalizability of our approach, we also perform additional experiments on LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct, and put the results in Section 5.4.

Datasets First, we directly use the model Qwen2.5-32B-Tag created in Section 3.2 as the tag model for reasoning effort-conditioned generation. As mentioned before, this tag model is trained on the seed data that contains 1.3K problems from a subset of NuminaMath, and totally 3.9K responses under three types of reasoning efforts generated by QwQ-32B-Preview. We then use this tag model to generate responses on an additional subset of NuminaMath containing extra 50K problems under different reasoning efforts. On each problem, we sample only 1 response for each reasoning effort, though we believe that performing multiple samplings could further enhance effectiveness. For each problem, we select the shortest correct response among all three responses to the problem as the thinking-optimal response. Finally, we incorporate the responses corresponding to low reasoning effort from the seed data into the above generated dataset, resulting in a thinking-optimal dataset of about 26K samples for self-improvement. We denote the self-improved model created by our method as Qwen2.5-32B-TOPS . We then evaluate the performance of our model on three typical math reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. The additional results on general reasoning tasks can be found in Appendix J.

Training and Evaluation Details In the SFT stage, the learning rate is 1 × 10 -5 , the batch size is 96 , and the number of epochs is 2. In inference, the decoding temperature is 1 . 0 , the maximum generation length is 16,384. We report the average accuracy across 5 random seeds in each experiment. The standard deviation results are in Appendix K. In the evaluation of MATH500, we also use gpt-4o to assist in identifying missed cases caused by format issues [8].

Baselines Besides the base model Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we compare our self-improved model with several existing o1-like models that are based on the same base model: (1) QwQ-32B-Preview : One of the most popular o1-like reasoning models developed by Qwen Team. (2) STILL-2-32B [25]: A System-2 thinking model trained on 3.9K challenging math examples generated by QwQ-32BPreview and DeepSeek-R1-Lite 7 . (3) Sky-T1-32B-Preview [26]: The reasoning model trained on 17K examples generated by QwQ-32B-Preview, including 10K math examples. (4) Qwen2.5-32BRandom : After the reasoning effort-based generation, we randomly select a correct solution on each problem rather than the shortest one to form a thinking-suboptimal dataset, and train the base model on this dataset.

## 5.2 Main results

The results of each model are displayed in Table 3. Besides the accuracy, we also report the number of CoT tokens used by each model on each dataset. 8

First, we can see that the model trained under thinking-optimal samples (Qwen2.5-32B-TOPS) consistently performs better than the model trained under thinking-suboptimal samples (Qwen2.532B-Random). This helps to revalidate our motivation that scaling with shortest correct responses, as determined by the base model itself using System-2 thinking, is the most effective approach to achieve optimal test-time scaling. Second, compared to distillation-based models STILL-2-32B and Sky-T1-32B-Preview, our self-improvement-based model Qwen2.5-32B-TOPS achieves better results across the board, except for AIME2024, where it slightly underperforms STILL-2-32B. However, note that STILL-2-32B uses a greater number of high-quality distilled samples (3.9K) including more challenging problems from AIME1983-2023, whereas our model achieves comparable performance using only 1.3K seed samples and effective self-improvement strategy.

Regarding the reasoning efforts (i.e., the number of reasoning tokens) used by each model to solve different difficulty levels of tasks, we observe that Qwen2.5-32B-TOPS uses fewer tokens on easier tasks like GSM8K compared to other models, effectively mitigating the issue of overthinking [3]. On the other hand, it tends to spend more time thinking on harder problems such as AIME2024. The comparison of reasoning tokens used by different models across various domains reflects our model's ability to exhibit adaptive reasoning depths.

## 5.3 Results of iterative self-improvement

To further enhance the reasoning performance of our model on challenging problems, we perform iterative self-improvement on Qwen2.5-32B-TOPS. Specifically, we select additional 4500 MATH problems [13] (which have not appeared in the previously used problems) and the problems from AIME1983-2023. On each problem, we sample 8 responses from Qwen2.5-32B-TOPS. Then, we select the shortest correct response among 8 responses as the chosen response. One iterative self-improvement approach is to further supervised fine-tune Qwen2.5-32B-TOPS on the dataset composed of all chosen responses (shortest correct responses), resulting in Qwen2.5-32B-TOPSIter-SFT . Besides, we can also perform preference optimization. Specifically, if there are responses with incorrect final answers, we select the longest incorrect response as the rejected response to improve reasoning capability. Additionally, we include preference pairs where the rejected response is the shortest wrong response if there exists a wrong response that is shorter than the shortest correct

8 For STILL-2-32B and Sky-T1-32B-Preview, we only calculate the number of tokens in the thought part and do not include the tokens in the summary part.

response, to avoid causing the model to underthink. After obtaining the preference dataset, we perform Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [32] on Qwen2.5-32B-TOPS to get Qwen2.5-32BTOPS-Iter-DPO . Detailed experimental settings are in Appendix E.

The results of iterative self-improvement are in Table 3. As we can observe, further SFT is mainly effective in shortening the CoT lengths but does not necessarily improve reasoning performance. Preference optimization improves both the efficiency and the effectiveness, resulting in a reasoning model that is comparable to QwQ-32B-Preview.

## 5.4 Results on LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct

Here, we display the results of performing our Thinking-Optimal Test-Time Scaling strategy on LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct in Table 4. The experimental setups are consistent with that in the main experiments above. The results demonstrate the generalizability of our method on other model architectures.

## 6 Conclusion

In this work, we aim to explore a potential issue under current pursuit of test-time scaling. Through empirical analysis on mathematical reasoning tasks, we first demonstrate that overly long CoTs can negatively impact the model's reasoning performance in certain domains, emphasizing the need for optimal CoT length scaling. To tackle this, we propose a Thinking-Optimal Scaling strategy, which first leverages a small set of seed data to teach LLMs to adopt varying levels of reasoning effort to perform System-2 thinking. Then, our approach allows models to identify the shortest correct response for self-improvement, leading to more efficient and effective System-2 thinking. Experimental results show that our self-improved and iteratively self-improved models, based on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, outperform existing distillation-based o1-like models and achieve comparable performance with QwQ-32B-Preview across various math benchmarks.

## 7 Limitations

There are some limitations in the current work: (1) Our analysis mainly focuses on the math reasoning domain, because math tasks offer relatively accurate and reliable performance verification. However, we believe investigating the potential impact of long CoTs in other domains is important, which can be a promising direction in future work. We also provide some preliminary results in the general reasoning domain in Appendix J. (2) This work primarily focuses on the SFT setting. While investigating effective SFT and distillation is very important and practical-as highlighted in concurrent studies [25, 38]-exploring the impact of CoT length in the reinforcement learning (RL) setting is another compelling direction. We believe that our findings can be extended to RL-based scaling. Specifically, since RL assigns positive rewards (e.g., 1.0) to all solutions with correct final answers, shorter correct solutions with fewer erroneous reasoning steps should be preferred over longer correct ones with more errors. Over-rewarding the latter may encourage the model to generate incorrect intermediate steps first and rely on its imperfect self-correction ability to correct erroneous steps, rather than producing the correct answer in one go.

## NeurIPS Paper Checklist

## 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The contributions and scope of the paper are well summarized in the abstract and introduction.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

## 2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the limitations of our work in the section Limitations in Section 7. Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

## 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

## 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We include the detailed data generation and experimental settings in Section 3.2, Section 5.1, and Appendix E to ensure the reproducibility of our experimental results.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

## 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have released the code and data. We have also provided the detailed instructions to curate data and reproduce experiments in Section 3.2, Section 5.1, and Appendix E.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so 'No' is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

## 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the complete experimental settings in Section 5.1 and Appendix E. Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

## 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The standard deviation results are displayed in Appendix K.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
- The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

- The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
- It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

## 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The details are in Appendix E.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

## 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The authors have reviewed and followed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

## 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the broader impacts of our paper in Appendix A.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
- Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

- The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

## 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not pose such risks.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

## 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have cited the original owners of assets used in this work properly in Section 3.2 and Section 5.1.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
- The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
- The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not release new assets. Our training and evaluation data is based on existing math data.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

## 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

- Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
- We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
- For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

## 16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have described in detail in Section 3.2, Section 3.3, and Section 5.1 how we use LLMs to curate training data and perform numerical analysis.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.
- Please refer to our LLM policy ( https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM ) for what should or should not be described.

Table 5: CoT token count returned from o1-mini API and estimated by Qwen2.5 tokenizer.

| Method            |   MATH500 |   AIME2024 |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| o1-mini API       |   1122.07 |    4861.87 |
| Qwen2.5 Tokenizer |   1110.88 |    4972.08 |

## A Impact statement

This work aims to explore the effectiveness and limitations of o1-like test-time scaling. Our goal is to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of test-time scaling in a more thinking-optimal way. These findings highlight the importance of adaptive reasoning efforts and provide a promising direction for more effectively enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

## B Details on estimating the number of tokens in hidden CoT of o1-mini by Qwen2.5 tokenizer

In the preliminary analysis in Section 3.1, we use Qwen2.5 tokenizer to calculate the number of tokens in the CoTs generated by each model for a fair comparison. However, o1-mini does not expose the internal CoTs to users, but only shows the summary parts S , along with the number of reasoning tokens n o 1 r and total number completion tokens n o 1 c (the sum of reasoning tokens and summary tokens) measured by o1-mini tokenizer. Therefore, we choose to estimate the number of tokens in its hidden CoTs measured by the Qwen2.5 tokenizer using S , n o 1 r and n o 1 c . Specifically, we denote the number of tokens of the summary part measured by Qwen2.5 tokenizer as n qwen s , then the estimated number of tokens of hidden CoT by Qwen2.5 tokenizer can be calculated as n qwen s × n o 1 r n o 1 c -n o 1 r .

We also display the comparison results on the CoT token count returned by the o1-mini API and the number of tokens we estimated using the Qwen2.5 tokenizer in Table 5. As we can see, the numbers do not differ significantly. Thus, we use the estimation results from the Qwen2.5 tokenizer in the main text in order to make a fair comparison of the number of reasoning tokens used by different models.

## F Breakdown results of tag models on MATH500

We display the breakdown results of tag models on MATH500 under different difficulty levels in Table 6. The results also validate the claim that continuously increasing the reasoning effort can indeed bring adverse effects , especially on lower-level problems (e.g., 92.09 (Low) -&gt; 87.44 (Medium/High) and 97.67 (Low) -&gt; 96.74 (Medium/High) on Level 1 problems for LLaMA3.1-8BTag and Qwen2.5-32B-Tag separately).

## G Response length distribution of QwQ-32B-Preview under different reasoning effort-based system prompts

We put the initial response length distribution of different reasoning-effort prompted responses on QwQ-32B-Preview in Table 7. As we can see, in nearly 15% of cases, the low reasoningeffort prompted responses are even the longest among all three responses. This indicates that only using direct prompting is unreliable to explore the impact of CoT length on reasoning performance. Therefore, when training tag models, for each training problem, we reorder the responses to ensure that the response lengths under different reasoning efforts follow an consistently increasing order from low to medium to high. In such a controlled setting, we can fairly observe the impact of CoT length on reasoning performance.

## H Performance of QwQ-32B-Preview and QwQ-32B when directly prompted with different reasoning effort-based prompts

Here, we display the performance of QwQ-32B-Preview [30] and QwQ-32B [31] on all three evaluation benchmarks when directly prompted with different reasoning effort-based prompts. Since QwQ-32B includes both reasoning and summary components in its responses and typically generates much longer CoTs, we extended its max\_seq\_len to 32K to allow for sufficient reasoning and summarization. The full results are in Table 8. These results re-validate our main claim: longer CoTs may not necessarily lead to better performance .

Table 8: The performance of QwQ-32B-Preview and QwQ-32B on three benchmarks when directly prompting the model with various reasoning effort-based prompts.

## I Results of fine-tuning on samples after filtering out solutions with erroneous steps

We conduct additional experiments on supporting the claim that including more erroneous rounds in the training stage can lead to greater adverse effects. Specifically, we filter out those solutions that contain erroneous steps (identified by GPT-4.1) under the high reasoning effort, and fine-tune Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct on the filtered data, which yields Qwen2.5-32B-Tag-High-Filtered. The results are in Table 9.

We have some interesting findings: (1) After removing samples containing erroneous rounds, the trained model produces much shorter CoTs. The reason is that the solutions removed are usually very lengthy as they contain more self-reflections and self-corrections, thus the average length of the dataset after removing these samples is much shorter. (2) Removing samples containing erroneous rounds brings significant performance improvement on GSM8K, while causing certain performance degradation on harder benchmarks MATH500 and AIME2024. The reason is that after removing those samples, the model cannot learn to effectively perform deeper thinking such as correcting the errors it could make in previous rounds. GSM8K is relatively simple, so the model does not need to engage in excessive reflection and correction. Therefore, removing these behaviors actually improves model performance. On more challenging datasets, the advantages of longer reasoning chains that include reflections and corrections become apparent. Moreover, by comparing with the results in Figure 5 in the main text, we find that instead of directly removing correct solutions that contain erroneous steps, a more effective approach is to apply loss masking specifically to the wrong steps. The latter strategy allows the model to retain the ability to learn how to correct previous mistakes, without explicitly learning from the erroneous steps themselves.

## J Results on general reasoning tasks

Here, we additionally prompt QwQ-32B-Preview to generate responses under different reasoning effort-based prompts on a subset of the WebInstruct-verified dataset [23], and curate a seed general reasoning dataset that contains correct responses with varying reasoning efforts. We then finetune Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct [29] on the seed dataset to get Qwen2.5-7B-Tag-General, and evaluate

its performance on MMLU-Pro [41] and GPQA-Diamond [33] using the same reasoning effortconditioned prompting strategy as in Section 3.2. We only sample once for each prompt considering the evaluation cost. The results are displayed in Table 10. The findings are consistent with the results in the math reasoning domain that excessive scaling with longer CoTs can bring negative effects to the model's performance in general reasoning tasks. Also, the model needs more reasoning effort to perform well on the more challenging task GPQA-Diamond.

Following the above setup, we then perform our thinking-optimal scaling on a held-out set of the WebInstruct-verified dataset to get Qwen2.5-7B-TOPS-General and perform random scaling to get Qwen2.5-7B-Random-General. The evaluation results in Table 10 show that our method can also work well for general reasoning tasks .
