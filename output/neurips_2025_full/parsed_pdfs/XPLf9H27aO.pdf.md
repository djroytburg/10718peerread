## Abstract

Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling, enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits. JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a 60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

## 1 Introduction

Photo retouching is fundamental to modern photography, enabling users to manipulate exposure, color, contrast, and tone for expressive, high-quality images. Commercial tools such as Adobe Lightroom and PicsArt offer extensive manual controls but demand specialized expertise and significant time investment, creating barriers for non-experts. Existing automated methods-including zero- and first-order optimization [15, 44, 54, 65], reinforcement learning [55, 29, 28], and diffusion-based editing [68, 2, 57]-improve automation yet remain limited in stylistic diversity, fine-grained adjustment, and scene generalization. More recently, instruction-guided multimodal models such as GPT-4o [24] and Gemini-2-Flash [52] have enabled natural-language-driven editing but frequently compromise content fidelity, intricate attribute control, and high-resolution support.

LLM [13, 4, 60, 33]-powered agents have driven breakthroughs in autonomous task execution and problem solving, inspiring us to explore a novel photo-retouching paradigm: an intelligent, userfriendly artist agent that interprets the user's intent and delivers professional-level edits . To this end, we introduce JarvisArt, which (1) accurately parses visual inputs and natural-language instructions, (2) embeds professional retouching expertise to emulate an artist's reasoning, (3) efficiently manages over 200 Lightroom operations, and (4) supports both global and local adjustments through an intuitive interface. All planning and tool invocations are fully transparent, allowing users to interactively refine the retouching workflow to suit their individual preferences.

To translate this vision into practice, we must tackle three core challenges:the scarcity of high-quality data (source/target images, textual instructions, and editing configurations), the need for expert-level reasoning strategies, and the absence of a standardized Agent-to-Lightroom integration protocol. To overcome these, we first design a data-generation pipeline that yields the MMArt-55K dataset, comprising 5K standard and 50K Chain-of-Thought-enhanced multi-granularity samples. Next, we employ a two-stage post-training regime: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill a workflow of 'understanding → reasoning → decision-making (recording Lightroom operations into a ROC file)', as illustrated in Figure 1, and (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization for Retouching (GRPOR) augmented with multi-dimensional tool-use rewards-namely, retouching-operation accuracy (evaluating both global and region-specific parameter prediction) and perceptual quality (assessing the visual fidelity of retouched outputs)-to refine decision-making and generalization. Finally, we introduce the Agent-to-Lightroom (A2L) protocol to enable seamless, automated Lightroom editing with bidirectional feedback. Consequently, JarvisArt deeply understands the intent of the user, generates diverse stylistic renditions, and seamlessly executes global and region-specific adjustments to produce visually compelling results (see Figure 1).

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

- We introduce JarvisArt, an intelligent artist agent powered by an MLLM and linked to over 200 Lightroom operations, capable of producing diverse, user-driven stylistic edits that surpass current automated methods and rival professional human retouchers.
- We design a scalable data-synthesis pipeline to construct the MMArt dataset, comprising 5K standard instruction-based and 50K Chain-of-Thought-enhanced multi-granularity samples for detailed retouching tasks.
- We develop a two-stage post-training regime: SFT followed by GRPO-R with tailored tool-use rewards to enhance the agent's reasoning, tool proficiency, and generalization.
- We establish an Agent-to-Lightroom communication protocol that enables seamless collaboration between JarvisArt and Lightroom, facilitating fully automated editing workflows.

## 2 Related Work

Photo Retouching. Existing automated pipelines have been proposed to streamline manual retouching. Zeroth- and First-order optimizations [15, 44, 43, 6, 54, 65, 53] were early attempts, but they are constrained by limited parameter prediction and reliance on pre-trained proxies. RL-based methods [55, 29, 28, 19, 45] attempt to mimic human workflows and offer some transparency but fail to capture artistic vision and lack deeper user interaction. Diffusion models [68, 2, 57, 75, 7, 59, 10] dominate high-fidelity image synthesis but rely on static prompts and lack multi-turn reasoning or flexible language alignment, limiting open-ended editing. Additionally, recent unified image editing models have achieved dual breakthroughs in comprehension and generation. Notable examples include closed-source models like GPT-4o [24] and Gemini-2-Flash [52], as well as open-source models such as Bagel [9], Janus-Pro [8], UniTok [41], QLIP [73], and VARGPT-v1.1 [76]. Despite these breakthroughs, three key limitations remain: (1) destructive editing by regenerating all pixels, compromising content preservation; (2) lack of interactive and interpretable local attribute control (e.g., softening or brightening skin); and (3) the absence of arbitrary-resolution editing due to generative model architectural constraints. Conversely, our study presents an interactive and interpretable retouching paradigm that integrates multimodal understanding with expert-level editing tools for non-destructive photo retouching. JarvisArt empowers users through a human-agent collaboration loop, enabling scene-level edits alongside precise region-specific tweaks-blending creative flexibility with the rigor of a professional workflow.

Reinforcement Fine-Tuning. Rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning, as demonstrated by OpenAI's o1 [25] and Deepseek-R1 [13], has shown impressive performance in tasks such as mathematical reasoning [4, 25, 61, 64], and code generation [22, 26, 67, 70]. Subsequent research has extended this approach to multimodal models, designing task-specific reward functions for visual perception tasks. These include correct class prediction in image classification [46, 5, 42], Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metrics in image localization and detection [39, 21, 62, 49], accurate click position prediction in GUI grounding tasks [40, 56], and effective interaction with search engines to leverage up-to-date external information [27]. However, unlike these tasks with a single correct answer, our task involves tool-integrated retouching, which requires predicting multiple tools and their parameters. Designing effective reward signals to support learning in this setting remains an open and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we propose customized tool-use rewards, enabling JarvisArt to equip advanced artistic reasoning and tool invocation capabilities.

LLM-Empowered Agent. LLM-powered agents have revolutionized AI systems due to three key developments: 1) unprecedented reasoning capabilities of LLMs [13, 4, 60, 16, 17]; 2) advancements in tool manipulation and environmental interaction [31, 51, 18, 20, 38, 34, 35, 11] and 3) sophisticated memory architectures that support longitudinal experience accumulation [14, 71, 58, 63]. Despite these advancements, three fundamental limitations persist when applying LLM agents to professional photo retouching: 1) the absence of a domain-specific retouching knowledge base, which hinders accurate interpretation of user intent, 2) limited decision-making abilities in selecting suitable tools and determining precise parameter values, and 3) absence of standardized protocols to ensure compatibility with professional retouching software integrations. To address these limitations, we propose JarvisArt, a powerful artistic agent that integrates three core capabilities: (1) professional retouching expertise for precise understanding of user instructions, (2) proficiency with commercial retouching tools in Lightroom, and (3) standardized communication protocols for seamless Lightroom integration.

Figure 2: The data generation pipeline comprises three main stages: 1) Curation of diverse source-target examples covering varied scenes and styles with corresponding Lightroom configurations; 2) Generation of diverse user instrcutions that reflects different creative intents; 3) Production of Chain-of-Thought traces that simulate a human artist reasoning process.

## 3 Method

We begin by outlining the overall workflow of JarvisArt (Sec. 3.1). Next, we introduce a comprehensive data generation pipeline that constructs MMArt, a high-quality dataset comprising instruction and reasoning samples for agentic photo retouching tasks (Sec. 3.2). Finally, we investigate the core components of JarvisArt (Sec. 3.3), including a two-stage post-training pipeline and the Agent-toLightroom (A2L) protocol, which allows seamless collaboration between JarvisArt and Lightroom.

## 3.1 Overview

JarvisArt is an interactive, MLLM-based photo-retouching system that supports both scene-level and region-level edits. In addition to textual instructions, users can specify local areas via free-form brushstrokes or draggable bounding boxes. In Figure 1, JarvisArt's pipeline comprises three stages: 1) Multi-modal context understanding to parse user directives, image content, and regions of interest; 2) Strategic reasoning grounded in photographic principles to formulate a retouching plan; and 3) Tool orchestration to select appropriate Lightroom operations and parameters. These operations are executed automatically through the A2L protocol. Formally, JarvisArt implements a function:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Q is the user query, I src the source image, and each t i denotes a specific Lightroom edit ( e.g. , exposure +0 . 03 ). The final output is obtained by I edit = g ( I src , T ) , with g ( · ) representing Lightroom's execution environment.

## 3.2 Data Generation Pipeline

We design a three-stage data-generation pipeline (Figure 2) to construct MMArt with explicit Chainof-Thought (CoT) annotations. Each sample is a five-tuple ⟨ I src , I tgt , Q, C , O ⟩ , where I src and I tgt are the before-/after-retouch images, Q the user's instruction, C the CoT reasoning wrapped in &lt;think&gt; tags, and O the retouching operation configuration (ROC) file of tool invocations and parameters

within &lt;answer&gt; tags. The pipeline proceeds as follows: 1) Curation of diverse source-target examples covering varied scenes and styles, and the corresponding Lightroom configurations; 2) Generation of natural-language instructions that reflect user intents; 3) Production of step-by-step reasoning traces. Further statistics and examples of MMArt can be found in Appendix A.

Stage I: Generation of image pairs and Lightroom configuration. We source raw images from PPR10K [32], the Adobe Lightroom community, and licensed open-source collections, then curate a diverse library of global and local artistic presets 2 . Leveraging Qwen2.5-VL-72B [60] for multimodal role-playing and Grounding DINO [37] for precise region localization, we simulate expert-level edits in four steps: 1) Region detection , in which Grounding DINO [37] identifies regions of interest (confidence &gt; 0.8); 2) Preset recommendation , where Qwen2.5-VL-72B [60] proposes global and local presets based on image aesthetics; 3) Preset application , applying each recommendation in Lightroom to generate five candidate retouched images; and 4) Human-in-the-loop validation , selecting the most artistically pleasing outputs. Each finalized sample comprises ⟨ I src , I tgt , O ⟩ , denoting the source image, the retouched image, and the detailed record of Lightroom operations. The role-playing prompts are detailed in Appendix A.4.

Stage II: Generation of user instructions. To simulate diverse editing intents, we employ Qwen2.5VL-72B [60] with a role-playing prompt (Appendix A.4) to translate each ⟨ I src , I tgt , O ⟩ triplet into both scene-level and region-level instructions Q . We generate descriptions for two user types-casual users and professional editors with advanced aesthetic sensibilities, ensuring coverage of simple global edits as well as precise, localized adjustments.

Stage III: Generation of reasoning processes. For each sample quadruple ⟨ I src , I tgt , Q, O ⟩ , we first apply QVQ-max's [60] advanced visual reasoning to generate initial CoT annotations. To remove redundancy and enforce human-like coherence, we subsequently refine these traces using Qwen2.5VL-72B [60] through iterative multimodal prompts, producing concise, context-rich reasoning processes C . Full prompt templates are provided in Appendix A.4.

## 3.3 JarvisArt Framework

## 3.3.1 CoT Supervised Fine-tuning

Drawing on Deepseek-R1 [13], we initialize JarvisArt via supervised fine-tuning on CoT annotations to bootstrap its subsequent reinforcement learning. This phase 1) enforces a consistent, structured output format, 2) instills foundational reasoning skills spanning user-intent interpretation and aesthetic judgment, and 3) establishes preliminary proficiency in selecting Lightroom tools and configuring their parameters.

## 3.3.2 Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning

Building on the SFT-initialized model, as shown in Figure 3, we apply group relative policy optimization for retouching(GRPO-R) [48] (Appendix B.1) to further refine JarvisArt's artistic reasoning and tool-use proficiency. GRPO-R trains the agent with three interpretable, task-specific rewards: a format reward R f that enforces structured output, a retouching operation accuracy reward R roa that measures the correctness of selected tools and their parameter settings, and a perceptual quality reward R pq that assesses the visual fidelity of the retouched image. The overall objective is thus R = R f + R roa + R pq ∈ [0 , 3] .

Format reward. Following prior work [13, 62, 49, 56], we include a format reward R f ∈ [0 , 1] to enforce structured outputs: reasoning must appear within &lt;think&gt; tags and tool invocations within &lt;answer&gt; tags, ensuring consistent and reliable parsing.

Retouching operation accuracy reward. Inspired by existing explorations of reward designs [47, 27, 40, 56] in the fields of GUI and web searching. We consider over 200 retouching tools in Lightroom, containing both global adjustments-such as exposure, highlights, and tone curve-and local refinements using six types of masks: 1) linear masks for directional gradients, 2) radial masks for circular or elliptical regions, 3) object masks for isolating subjects ( e.g. , people or objects), 4) color masks for hue-specific adjustments, 5) luminance masks for brightness-based selections, and 6)

2 In Lightroom, a preset refers to a pre-saved retouching operation configuration (ROC) file, typically created by photographers or artists. It encapsulates stylistic parameters tailored for specific visual aesthetics.

Figure 3: Overview of the two-stage post-training framework. Initially, JarvisArt undergoes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on CoT-annotated data to develop foundational artistic reasoning and tool-use skills. Following this, we apply the Group Relative Policy Optimization for Retouching (GRPO-R) algorithm to further enhance the JarvisArt's reasoning, tool proficiency, and generalization.

portrait masks for fine-tuning facial features such as skin and eyes. Further details are provided in Appendix E. To assess the accuracy of predicted tools and their parameters, T pre = { T pre 1 , ..., T pre M } , against the ground truth T tgt = { T tgt 1 , ..., T tgt N } , we define the ROA reward based on three evaluation criteria:

- ➊ Tool name matching:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where N T pre and N T tgt are the sets of tool names in the predicted and target sequences, respectively.

- ➋ Parameter name matching:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where keys ( · ) denotes the set of parameter names associated with a predicted or ground-truth tool. It is noted that an overlap in parameter names occurs only when the predicted and ground-truth tool names match.

## ➌ Parameter value matching:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where S k ( · ) ∈ [0 , 1] quantifies the correspondence between predicted and ground-truth parameter values, with a value of 1 indicating an exact match. Specifically, if the key k is absent in T pre i , then T pre i [ k ] is undefined and S k = 0 . The computation of S k depends on the parameter type: scalar differences for standard numerical values, intersection-over-union (IoU) for object masks, endpoint distance for linear masks, geometric similarity for radial masks, color distance between sampled points for color masks, luminance range differences for luminance masks, and category-specific criteria for portrait masks. Refer to Appendix B.2 for further details. Finally, the retouching operation accuracy reward is computed by measuring the matching degree between T pre and T tgt :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Perception quality reward . While parameter-based rewards offer critical guidance, they may not fully capture the perceptual quality of the final image, as different parameter settings can produce visually similar results. To address this limitation, we introduce the PQ reward, which evaluates two

key aspects: 1) global tone consistency via color distribution matching, and 2) pixel-wise fidelity. The reward is defined as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where I edit is the retouched image and I tgt is the target image. CD ( · ) measures color distribution similarity in CIELAB space [69] and L ( · ) denotes the pixel-wise distance. Both metrics are normalized to the range [0, 1], with higher values indicating better similarity. The weighting factor is empirically set to γ = 0 . 4 to balance both terms.

## 3.3.3 Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol

Figure 4 presents the Agent-to-Lightroom (A2L) protocol, a standardized client-server interface that integrates JarvisArt with Lightroom. The workflow comprises five stages: 1) handshake, 2) file verification, 3) sandboxed execution, 4) async processing, and 5) result return. A2L features dual-transport communication, a structured message format, and resource management. Messages use bar-delimited commands for processing, status, and error handling, enhancing clarity and efficiency. It manages source images and retouching operation configuration (ROC) files, supporting ROC-to-Lua translation, and integrity checks. The source image can by directly retouched by Lua file in Lightroom. The Lua file can be directly applied in Lightroom to retouch the source image. Additional details are provided in the supplementary materials.

## 4 Experiment

## 4.1 Experimental Setup

Implementation details. We adopt Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct [1] as the base model for JarvisArt. The CoT supervised fine-tuning phase is performed on 50K CoT-annotated instances from MMArt, with a batch size of 2, a learning rate of 1e-5, and training for 2 epochs using the Llama-Factory framework [74] on 8 A100 (80G) GPUs. The reinforcement learning phase, employing the GRPO-R algorithm, is conducted on 5K standard instruction samples from MMArt, using the veRL framework [50]. For each training step, we sample a batch of 2, a learning rate of 1e-6, and generate 4 responses per query, training for 2 epochs on 16 A100 (80G) GPUs.

MMArt-Bench. To provide a comprehensive evaluation of JarvisArt's performance, we introduce the MMArt-Bench, which is sampled from the MMArt dataset. It includes four main scenarios: portrait, landscape, street scenes, and still life, with 50 instances per category, totaling 200 instances. Each primary category contains multiple subcategories (Appendix A.1). For region-level evaluation, we utilize a portrait subset comprising 50 human-centered images with mask annotations.

Evaluation metrics. Following previous works [68, 30], six assessment metrics are use for evaluation: L1, L2, SC, PQ, and O. L1 and L2 to measure the average pixel-level absolute difference between the retouched image and reference image. SC evaluates the alignment between the instruction text and the image (0-10 scale). PQ evaluates contextual coherence and artifact presence (0-10 scale). The overall score O is calculated as O = √ SC × PQ. For region-specific evaluation, we apply these six metrics to a specified mask region. Further details are provided in Appendix C.1.

Baselines. For a fair comparison, we evaluate JarvisArt against leading open-source photo retouching methods, including 3DLUT [66] and RSFNet [45], as well as instruction-driven editing models such as InstructPix2Pix [2], MagicBrush [68], OmniGen [57], VARGPT-v1.1 [76] and Step1XEdit [36]. Proprietary solutions such as GPT-4o 3 [24] and Gemini-2- Flash [52] 4 are also included

## 4.2 Experimental Results

## 4.2.1 Evaluation on MMArt-Bench

As shown in Table 1, JarvisArt outperforms most open-source instruction-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all 10 evaluation metrics. Compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o [25] and Gemini-2-Flash [52], JarvisArt achieves superior content preservation-for

instance, an L1 × 10 2 score of 12.44, which is 45.6% lower (and thus better) than GPT-4o's score of 22.84. JarvisArt also demonstrates competitive instruction-following capability (O = 8.52), closely matching GPT-4o (O = 9.18) and outperforming Gemini-2 Flash (O = 8.08). Notably, in the local editing setting-where content fidelity is especially critical-the advantage of our method over GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash is significantly amplified. As illustrated in Figure 5, especially in portrait scenarios, competing methods often exhibit noticeable uncanny valley effects, producing significant visual artifacts that diverge from users' creative intent. In contrast, JarvisArt mitigates these issues through its Lightroom-integrated workflow, enabling high-quality, non-destructive editing. More results in Appendix D.

## 4.2.2 User Preference Study

Evaluating instruction-driven photo retouching remains inherently subjective, as even expert evaluators often disagree on the "optimal" outcome. To quantify preferences, we conducted a user preference study on the MMArt-Bench, recruiting 80 participants to evaluate four

advanced algorithms: Step1X-Edit [36], Gemini-2-Flash [52], GPT-4o [24], and JarvisArt. Evaluations focus on two criteria: (1) image consistency (preservation of source image content) and (2) aesthetic quality (visual appeal of retouched results). A five-point ordinal scale (worst = 2, poor = 4, fair = 6, good = 8, and excellent = 10) for quantitative metrics. Results in Figure 6 show JarvisArt achieves best subjective quality, producing edits favored by users.

## 4.2.3 Visualization of Reward Trends for GRPO-R

Figure 7 shows additional visualizations of GRPO-R training. The format reward converges quickly early on. While the PQ reward initially fluctuates and grows gradually, the ROA reward rises more rapidly-likely because the model inherits "parameter preferences" from the SFT phase. As a result, it first focuses on the more easily optimized ROA, then gradually shifts attention to the PQ reward, which requires longer exploration due to the broader search space, where different edit operations may yield similar visual outcomes. Moreover, unlike Deepseek-R1 [13], JarvisArt does not display a clear 'aha moment'. This absence may stem from the lack of intermediate visual feedback during the artistic reasoning process. For example, when the model makes a hypothetical retouching adjustment like highlight+5, it cannot obtain the corresponding visual result, preventing the model from validating this step's correctness within the decision-making chain. Unlike mathematical problem-solving, where each step can be validated immediately, our artistic reasoning involves numerous retouching parameters. If we perform step-wise validation for each parameter, it would require high concurrency in calling Lightroom. This is impractical due to the high computational cost and the slow training speed. Investigating step-wise visual rewards within proxy validation environments may offer a promising approach to eliciting the 'aha moment'. We intend to explore in future work.

## 5 Ablation Study

Training strategy. We assess the impact of different post-training strategies by comparing model performance under three settings: 1) SFT on 50K CoT-enhanced samples, 2) GRPO-R training on 5K standard samples from scratch; and 3) GRPO-R fine-tuning basd on SFT-initial model. Rows 2-4 in Table 2 show that SFT yields better results than GRPO-R trained from scratch. This is likely because, without SFT to instill the basic reasoning and tool-use abilities, the GRPO-R training process must explore a significantly larger search space, thereby hindering optimization. Our combined SFT+GRPO-R strategy achieves the best results, suggesting that GRPO-R can effectively enhance the SFT-initialized model's reasoning, tool proficiency, and generalization by expanding its exploration capacity.

Reward design. As shown in Rows 6-8 of Table 2, individual reward combinations (Format+ROA or Format+PQ) result in suboptimal performance, with Format+PQ performing slightly better-possibly because PQ aligns more closely with the ultimate objective of enhancing visual quality and offers a broader optimization space to escape local optima. The full combination (Format+PQ+ROA) achieves the highest performance. This result aligns with our intuition that parameter-oriented (ROA) and perception-driven (PQ) rewards are complementary: ROA ensures parameter accuracy, while PQ maintains visual fidelity. The multi-dimensional reward system provides a balanced optimization signal, guiding the model to predict accurate edit operations while preserving high visual quality.

## 6 Conclusion

This report introduces JarvisArt, an interactive and interpretable MLLM-guided agent that integrates with 200+ Lightroom editing tools, enabling non-destructive editing on images of any-resolution. To develop this artist agent, we propose a new data generation pipeline that curates the MMArt55K dataset, comprising 5K standard and 50K CoT-enhanced samples. Based on this dataset, we train JarvisArt using a two-stage post-training regimen: 1) CoT SFT to instill basic reasoning and tool-use abilities, and 2) GRPO-R to improve the agent's reasoning, tool proficiency, and generalization through customized tool-use rewards: retouching operation accuracy reward for assessing the predicted editing operations, and the perceptual quality reward to evaluate the visual fidelity of the edited outputs. Furthermore, to enable seamless, automated Lightroom editing, we introduce the Agent-to-Lightroom protocol. Evaluation results from our MMArt-Bench demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing advanced image editing algorithms.

## NeurIPS Paper Checklist

## 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The abstract and introduction sections offer a comprehensive discussion of the manuscript's context, intuition, and ambitions, as well as its contributions.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

## 2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The limitations of the work are discussed by authors at the end of the paper.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

## 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: For each theoretical result, the paper provides the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.

- All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

## 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

## Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The pipeline of the methods and the details of experiments are presented with corresponding reproducible credentials.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

## 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/public/ guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so 'No' is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/public/ guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.

- The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

## 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The pipeline of the methods and the details of experiments are presented with corresponding reproducible credentials.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

## 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The results contain the standard deviation of the results over several random runs.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
- The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
- The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
- It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

## 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The details of experiments are presented with corresponding reproducible credentials.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

- The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

## 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

## 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Despite JarvisArt's strong artistic reasoning and tool-use capabilities, limitations remain. First, it lacks support for advanced Lightroom AI features like background removal, which we plan to address through paired artist-edited data generation. Second, GRPO-R training on only 5K samples may introduce bias; expanding this dataset could improve generalization.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
- Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
- The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

## 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.

- Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

## 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The original owners of assets, including data and models, used in the paper, are properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected.

Guidelines:

- For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
- If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
- For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
- If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

## 13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

## 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

- Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.

- According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

## 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
- We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
- For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

## A Details of the MMArt dataset.

## A.1 Statistics of the MMArt dataset

Figure 8(a) illustrates the composition and distribution of scenarios in our MMArt dataset. The dataset is structured into four major scene categories that reflect common real-world photo retouching contexts: portrait (40.8%, including shooting purposes, shooting time/lights, subjects, and indoor/outdoor scenes), landscape (33.3%, comprising nature, city, aerial photography,travel, underwater, night scene and architecture), street scenes (5.71%, including sports, life, event and documentary), and still life (20.2%, encompassing food, close-up scenes, black/white photography, art and animals). Each major category contains a diverse set of subcategories, ensuring comprehensive coverage and representativeness. Furthermore, Figure 8(b) displays a word cloud of user instructions, highlighting the linguistic diversity of the instructions.

## A.2 Comparison of Existing Datasets

Table 3 presents a comparison between our MMArt dataset and existing image editing datasets. MMArt is designed with the following key properties to facilitate advanced research in image retouching:

- Real Images: All samples in MMArt are real photographs, ensuring the dataset's authenticity and practical value for real-world applications.
- Diverse User Instructions: Each image is paired with detailed user instructions, capturing a wide variety of editing intentions and reflecting the diversity of natural language expressions.
- Flexible Resolution: MMArt supports images of any resolution, including high-resolution samples, making it suitable for both research and practical deployment scenarios.
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Annotations: The dataset provides CoT reasoning annotations, which help to reveal the underlying logic and step-by-step process of user intent understanding and image editing.
- Lightroom Retouching Configuration: For every sample, MMArt includes comprehensive Lightroom parameter configurations, allowing for non-destructive, reproducible, and transparent image editing.

These properties make MMArt a high-quality, flexible, and richly annotated resource for the development and evaluation of advanced image retouching techniques.

## A.3 Data Samples of MMArt

The diversity of collected photos is shown in Figure 9. Moreover, Figure 10 demonstrates MMArt samples with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, while Figure 11 shows standard examples without CoT annotations.

## A.4 Prompt Templates

The prompt templates utilized throughout the various stages of MMArt are summarized here-Aesthetic Preset Recommendation (Figure 21), User Instruction Simulation (Figures 22 and 23), and Chain-of-Thought Data Construction (Figure 24 and 25).

## B Additional Method Details

## B.1 Group Relative Policy Optimization

In GRPO, given a task question, the model generates a set of N potential responses { O 1 , O 2 , . . . , O N } . Each response is evaluated by taking the corresponding actions and computing its reward { R 1 , R 2 , . . . , R N } . Unlike PPO, which relies on a single reward signal and a critic to estimate the value function, GRPO normalizes these rewards to calculate the relative advantage of each response. The relative quality A i of the i-th response is computed as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Mean and Std represent the mean and standard deviation of the rewards, respectively. This normalization step ensures that responses are compared within the context of the group, allowing GRPO to better capture nuanced differences between candidates. Policy updates are further constrained by minimizing the KL divergence between the updated and reference models, ensuring stable RL learning. Refer to [13, 48] for more details.

## B.2 Details of Reward Calculation

The parameter value matching function S k ( · ) for each parameter k is determined based on its specific type. Let V pre k and V tgt k denote the predicted and ground truth values for the k -th parameter, respectively. For notational simplicity, we omit the subscript k in the following formulas. The calculation proceeds as follows:

Figure 9: Visual examples to demonstrate the diversity of the proposed dataset.

<!-- image -->

- Scalar Parameters. For scalar parameters such as exposure or contrast, the matching function S is defined as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where | · | represents the absolute error between the predicted and ground truth values.

- Linear Gradient Masks. We assess the similarity between predicted and target linear gradient masks by measuring the distances between their start points p s = ( x s , y s ) and end points p e = ( x e , y e ) , with coordinates normalized to [0,1] for resolution invariance. The similarity score is computed as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ∥ · ∥ denotes Euclidean distance.

- Radial Gradient Masks. We measure similarity between predicted and target radial gradient masks using three geometric parameters: center position c = ( x, y ) , scale factors ( W,H ) , and rotation angle θ . Center point similarity is given by:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where c pre and c tgt are normalized to [0,1]. Further, scaling similarity compares width/height ratios:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The angle numerical value similarity is defined by:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The final similarity score combines these components as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- Object Masks. For object masks, the similarity score S is defined as the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) between the predicted B pre and ground truth B tgt bounding boxes. Each box is parameterized as [ x 1 , y 1 , x 2 , y 2 ] . The similarity score is computed as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where higher values indicate better alignment, with S = 1 denoting perfect overlap and S = 0 indicating no intersection.

- Portrait Masks. In portrait masks, the model predicts different special category IDs to denote distinct regions, such as ID=0 for face, ID=1 for hair, ID=2 for eyes, ID=3 for skin, etc. The matching score S is defined as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- Color Range Masks. To evaluate color range mask similarity, we sample N representative points from both predicted and target color distributions and compute the mean CIEDE2000 color difference ∆ E 100 in LAB color space. The similarity score is given by:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where c pre n and c tgt n denote the n -th sampled colors from the predicted and ground-truth distributions, respectively.

- Luminance Range Masks. To evaluate luminance range mask similarity, we compare the predicted and target luminance extremes by computing their absolute differences. The similarity score is defined as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the denominator normalizes by the target luminance range to ensure scale invariance.

## B.3 Hyper-parameter Setting

To ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete hyperparameter settings for both the SFT and GRPO-R phases in Table 4.

## C Additional Experimental Details

## C.1 Calculation of Local Metrics

To evaluate the model's effectiveness in localized regions, we compute six metricsL1 RC , L2 RC , SC RC , PQ RC , and O RC -using human-centric masks from the portrait subset of MMArt-Bench. For L1 RC and L2 RC , inspired by PPR10K [32], given an image I with resolution H × W , we define a weighting matrix W I = [ w i,j ] ∈ R H × W , where w i,j = 1 for human regions and w i,j = α ( α ≤ 1) for background regions, with α empirically set to 0.5. For instance, the human-centric L1 difference metric is expressed as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where I pred and I tgt are the predicted and target images, respectively, and ◦ denotes element-wise multiplication. The L2 RC metric is defined in a similar manner. For SC RC , PQ RC , and O RC , with α empirically set to 0, we focus solely on the mask region of the edited image and prompt the MLLM to emphasize local adjustments.

Table 5: Quantitative evaluation on MMArt-Bench. We highlight the best and second-best instruction-based results. SC, PQ, and O refer to the metrics evaluated by Qwen2.5-VL-72B [1]. The RC means the metric calculated on specific mask region.

## C.2 Prompt for MLLM-based Metrics

As shown in Figure 20, we present the evaluation prompts utilized for both scene-level and region-level assessments of the Semantic Consistency (SC) and Perceptual Quality (PQ) metrics. Notably, the overall score is calculated as O = √ SC × PQ.

## D Additional Experimental Results

## D.1 Additional Quantitative Evaluation by Qwen2.5-VL-72B

As shon in Table 5, to further evaluate MLLM-based metrics, we conducted an additional quantitative analysis using Qwen2.5-VL-72B [1]. Our findings suggest that such metrics may be unreliable, struggle to effectively reflect a model's instruction-following capability. Despite this, our model demonstrates instruction-following performance comparable to that of contemporary SOTA closed-source model GPT-4o, while achieving a significant improvement in content fidelity.

## D.2 Examples of Intricate Retouching Tasks with JarvisArt

Figures 12-15 present the challenging retouching examples, which involve both global and local editing demands, as well as vague user instructions. JarvisArt excels in understanding these ambiguous intentions, applying modifications at both the scene and region levels, and delivering visually effective results in the final images.

## D.3 More Visual Comparisons

Figures 16-19 present additional photo retouching results from the MMArt-Bench and MIT-FiveK, highlighting the superiority of JarvisArt in terms of instruction adherence, content fidelity, and visual appeal, while also achieving the style most similar to the target image. Notably, we also include a visual comparison with two commercial editing tools: Adobe Lightroom and Google Photo' auto-retouching modes.

## D.4 Comparison on MIT-FiveK

To assess the generalization ability of our system, we conduct comprehensive qualitative and visual comparisons on the MIT-FiveK [3] benchmark dataset. Specifically, we randomly select 50 data samples from MIT-FiveK [3] and generate corresponding user instructions based on the source images, expert C's reference images, and the associated retouching parameter configurations (see Section 3.2 for implementation details). As shown in Table 6 and Figures 18 and 19, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both instruction-following and content preservation metrics. These results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our method in faithfully executing user instructions while maintaining original image content. Furthermore, our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines on multiple real-world benchmarks, highlighting its strong generalization ability and practical applicability in interactive photo retouching.

## Input:

<!-- image -->

## User Instruction ：

&lt;Image&gt; I wanted the scene to pop more, making the cathedral stand out with enhanced details. The water needed a cooler tone, while the bridge and path should appear darker for depth. Overall, I aimed for a balanced look that emphasizes the architecture and adds a cinematic feel.

## Answer with CoT annotation:

&lt;think&gt; Alright, I've got this image showing a bridge, cathedral, and river. The goal? Enhance the cathedral's details, cool the water, darken the bridge/path, and achieve a cinematic feel. The image appears muted, with vibrant water needed. For the cathedral, I'll boost clarity to 10 and use sharpening. To cool the water, I'll adjust blue saturation to -40 and apply split toning. Darkening the bridge/path involves local exposure reductions in masks. A cinematic look comes from increasing vibrance to 20, adjusting HSL, and using a vignette. Highlights at 100 may be too much; I'll tweak that. Yellow hue shift (-88) might alter the cathedral unnaturally. I'll check these and refine. Compositionwise, the vignette and local darkening will focus on the cathedral. Final tweaks ensure the image meets the vision. &lt;think&gt;

Figure 11: Data samples from MMArt with standard instructions.

Input:

<!-- image -->

## User Instruction ：

&lt;Image&gt; I want a cyberpunk vibe with neon lights and sharp contrasts for a futuristic city feel.

## JarvisArt:

&lt;think&gt; Alright, the user wants a cyberpunk vibe with neon lights and sharp contrasts. The image features illuminated signs and light trails at night, perfect for this theme. I'll start by adjusting the white balance to 3200K for a cooler tone. Next, I'll recover highlights in neon lights and open shadows slightly to keep details. Increasing contrast will enhance light-dark differences without harshness. Vibrance and saturation boosts will make colors pop, especially neons. Clarity and dehaze adjustments will sharpen details and cut through haze. Using the "Adobe Color" look with an amount of 1 will complement these changes. Local masks will refine specific areas, ensuring consistency. Checking sharpness and noise reduction will maintain quality. Finally, applying the provided tone curve values will shape brightness and contrast perfectly. This approach captures the futuristic city feel the user desires. &lt;think&gt;

## User Instruction ：

&lt;Image&gt;  Make  the  image  evoke  a  sense  of  loneliness  and  introspection,  with  soft  lighting  highlighting  the  solitary  figure  within  the &lt;box&gt;0.446, 0712, 0.540, 0.841&lt;/box&gt;.

## JarvisArt:

&lt;think&gt; Alright, focusing on evoking loneliness and introspection in the image of a solitary figure in a forest. The person is centered at &lt;box&gt;0.446, 0.712, 0.540, 0.841&lt;/box&gt;. The dense forest sets a quiet mood. To enhance solitude, I'll adjust lighting around this area. A slight warming with White Balance settings (Incremental Temperature 15, Tint 10) adds melancholy. Exposure2012 at 1.25 brightens the scene, while Contrast2012 at 17 enhances details. Shadows2012 set to 47 reveals more around the person. Vibrance increased by 10 boosts less saturated colors subtly. HueAdjustment values (-100 for Yellow, Green, Purple; -36 for Aqua) harmonize the palette. PostCropVignetteAmount  at  -21  darkens  edges,  drawing  focus  to  the  center.  These  adjustments  create  a  poignant,  introspective atmosphere. &lt;think&gt;

## User Instruction ：

&lt;Image&gt; I want this image to have a soft, misty style. In the &lt;box&gt;[0.3, 0.25, 0.7, 0.6]&lt;/box&gt; area, which is the face and upper body of the figure, I wanted the skin color to be smoother and more natural. The overall colors should blend softly, with a warm, green feeling that evokes nostalgia. The foliage in the background should be vibrant but not too strong, creating a serene atmosphere.

## Answer with CoT annotation:

&lt;think&gt; Alright, I've got this image to edit for a soft, misty style. The user wants smoother skin tones and gentle color blending with a warm, vintage feel, focusing on the person's face and upper body in &lt;box&gt;0.3 0.25 0.7 0.6&lt;/box&gt;. The background foliage should stay vibrant but not overpowering. First, I'll adjust the white balance for warmth. Then, apply a slight blur or glow effect for the misty style. For the skin tones, I'll use masks to reduce saturation and smooth textures in the specified area. Next, I'll tweak the tone curve to soften contrasts and warm up highlights and midtones. Background colors will be balanced to complement the foreground without being too intense. Adding subtle film grain can enhance the vintage look. Finally, I'll ensure all elements harmonize for a serene, nostalgic atmosphere. These steps align with the user's vision while preserving the original image's quality.&lt; think&gt;

## User Instruction ：

&lt;Image&gt; My goal was to create an atmospheric, nostalgic look. For the area &lt;box&gt;[0.3, 0.25, 0.7, 0.6]&lt;/box&gt; around her face and shoulders, I wanted smoother textures and a subtle haze effect. The entire image should evoke a sense of timelessness with muted colors and enhanced contrast, making it feel like a classic portrait.

## Answer with CoT annotation:

&lt;think&gt; Alright, let's dive into this image. The user wants a nostalgic feel with smooth textures and a subtle haze around the person's face and shoulders in &lt;box&gt;0.3 0.25 0.7 0.6&lt;/box&gt;. We'll warm the white balance to 5185K for that vintage vibe. A slight overexposure of 0.23 brightens the subject, while contrast at 7 adds depth. Highlights reduced by -71 and shadows boosted by 50 preserve detail. Texture at 25 and clarity at 14 enhance details globally, but local dehaze softens the specified area. Vibrance up by 20 enriches colors subtly. Split toning with shadow hue at 229 and highlight hue at 48 adds a vintage touch. A dark vignette draws focus to the center. These tweaks balance global adjustments with targeted corrections, achieving the classic portrait look the user desires. &lt;think&gt;
