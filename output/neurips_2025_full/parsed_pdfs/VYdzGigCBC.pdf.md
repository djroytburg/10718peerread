## Abstract

Large recommender models have extended LLMs as powerful recommenders via encoding or item generation, and recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning synchronously motivate the exploration of reasoning in recommendation. In this work, we propose R 2 ec, a unified large recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capability. R 2 ec introduces a dual-head architecture that supports both reasoning chain generation and efficient item prediction in a single model, significantly reducing inference latency. To overcome the lack of annotated reasoning data, we design RecPO, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes reasoning and recommendation jointly with a novel fused reward mechanism. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that R 2 ec outperforms traditional, LLMbased, and reasoning-augmented recommender baselines, while further analyses validate its competitive efficiency among conventional LLM-based recommender baselines and strong adaptability to diverse recommendation scenarios.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in contextual understanding and open-ended generation [1-5]. This success has catalyzed the development of large recommender models that inherit and specialize in the advantages of LLMs for recommendation. Current approaches can be divided into two main streams: one employs LLMs as powerful encoders to embed users (their historical interactions) [6-8], while the other reformulates item prediction into the autoregressive generation of item identifiers [4, 9]. These large recommender models exhibit remarkable generalization capabilities, achieving advanced performance across diverse application scenarios, including cold-start recommendations [10], cross-domain personalization [11], and longtail item prediction [12, 13]. The frontier of LLM capabilities now extends beyond model size scaling to test-time scaling, i.e., reasoning. Emerging advances like DeepSeek-R1 [14] demonstrates that such extra computation during inference can further improve LLM capabilities in areas such as mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving [15]. Given that large recommender models are instantiated from pretrained LLMs, a natural question is: how can large recommender model benefit from reasoning to further enhance recommendation performance?

Existing studies have preliminarily explored LLM reasoning for recommendation, including user preference analysis [16, 17], synthetic item profile enrichment [18, 19], user search query rewriting [20, 21], and rating prediction [22]. These approaches typically take LLMs as additional reason-

ing modules to augment the original recommendation pipeline, decoupling reasoning from item prediction. However, such designs introduce crucial limitations: 1) Significant resource cost. Two distinct modules, namely the large reasoning model and the recommendation model, must be trained, checkpointed, and served in parallel, inflating both memory footprint and inference latency. 2) Suboptimal joint optimization. Reasoning and recommendation modules can only be trained by freezing one while updating the other [16, 23]. This alternate optimization scheme prevents gradient flow across the pipeline, precluding true end-to-end learning, hindering fine-grained alignment between reasoning and ranking objectives, and ultimately leading to suboptimal convergence. In this work, we aim to develop a unified large recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capabilities, exploring new technical solutions for reasoning-enhanced recommendation systems.

It is non-trivial to develop a unified large recommender model with reasoning due to the following aspects: 1) Model design. Most large recommender models rely on autoregressive decoding of item identifiers (IDs), which can be computationally expensive [1-4, 24-26]. Introducing reasoning would inevitably exacerbate the latency. Thus, a key challenge is to integrate reasoning while maintaining acceptable inference speed. 2) Training optimization. A major obstacle in training the reasoning recommender is the scarcity of high-quality, annotated reasonings in recommendation domains. Unlike general QA tasks where solution rationales can be curated, the underlying rationale for recommendation is inherently subjective and difficult to collect at scale. Reinforcement Learning (RL) [21, 27, 28] is a natural alternative, but it introduces recommendation-specific challenges in reward specification and objective design. The training framework must effectively couple the reasoning and recommendation objectives to ensure co-optimization.

To address the above issues, we propose a unified large Rec ommender model with intrinsic R easoning, dubbed as R 2 ec . Our approach is built on two pillars: 1) Model design. As illustrated in Figure 1, we equip an LLM with a dual-head design: a standard language head for reasoning and a novel recommendation head for item prediction. The recommendation head maps the model's output to a shared semantic item embedding space. This allows the model to first generate a reasoning chain autoregressively and then select the final item in a single step, replacing the slow auto-regressive decoding of item IDs with a more efficient "next-item prediction". 2) Optimization. we propose RecPO , an RL-based training framework without human reasoning annotations. First, for a given input, we sample multiple diverse reasoning paths, each culminating in an item recommendation, forming "reasoning-then-item" sequences analogous to those in reasoning LLMs. Second, we found it insufficient to set the reward naively as ranking metrics, we thus propose a fused reward scheme that combines discrete ranking rewards with continuous similarity rewards. Finally, we formulate a joint training objective that leverages the rewards to optimize the model, encouraging it to develop reasoning pathways that lead to high-quality recommendations.

We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of R 2 ec by comparing it with various traditional, LLM-based, and reasoning-augmented recommendation baselines. The experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that R 2 ec significantly outperforms all baseline methods, verifying the effectiveness of its unified architect and its ability to leverage reasoning for superior recommendation quality. Our comprehensive evaluation comprises nine analyses, including a detailed

profiling of the model's reasoning behavior which reveals its context-aware capabilities; an efficiency analysis showing competitive inference speed among LLM-based recommenders; ablation and optimization studies on key components; and additional investigations into scalability, generalization and case studies.

Key contributions are as follows:

- Weintroduce R 2 ec, the first unified large recommender model that intrinsically integrates reasoning and recommendation within a single architecture, resulting in significantly lower inference latency compared to both reasoning-augmented and conventional LLM-based recommender baselines.
- We propose RecPO, an RL framework for recommendation that enables model optimization without reasoning annotations. We derive a joint optimization objective and propose a fused reward scheme, yielding performance that significantly surpasses all baselines.
- Beyond metrics, we provide an in-depth analysis of the model's reasoning behavior, demonstrating that R 2 ec automatically develops context-aware reasoning strategies tailored to specific domains and user contexts, offering meaningful interpretability for its recommendations.

## 2 Preliminaries

## 2.1 LLM-based Recommendation

LLM-based recommendation is an emerging paradigm, and the most applicable approach is to leverage LLMs as encoders to embed users and items, which are widely adopted in industry [29, 24, 30]. Typically, the recommendation process within this paradigm involves the following structured steps:

User and Item Formulation. Structured interaction histories and item metadata are first formulated into natural language prompts suitable for LLMs. We first collect a user's historically interacted items with the corresponding ratings. We then construct a textual prompt includes both the instruction and a natural-language description of these past behaviors. E.g., ' User has purchased and rated the following products sequentially: 1. 'Avatar Blu-ray' (4/5); 2. 'Wireless Headphones' (5/5); . . . Recommend the next item. ' Finally, we tokenize this prompt into a sequence of tokens, denoted as x u , which serves as the LLM input. Likewise, each candidate item v can be described using its metadata, then tokenized into a sequence of tokens x v .

The tokenized textual prompts x u and x v are then input into the LLM transformer backbone, by extracting the final hidden state of the input sequence, we can obtain corresponding user embedding h u and item embedding h v .

Training via Contrastive Learning. To optimize LLM for recommendation tasks, in-batch contrastive loss is typically adopted:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where τ is the temperature hyperparameter controlling similarity dispersion, B is the ground truth item set in one batch, and v + is the groud-truth target item.

Inference. During inference, recommendation score s ( u, v ) for each user-item pair is computed via the inner product between their embeddings: s ( u, v ) = h ⊤ u h v . Finally, we rank all items according to the scores and obtain topK item recommendation list.

## 2.2 Reinforcement Learning for Large Reasoning Models

Terminologies and Notations. RL for LLMs treats text generation as a sequential action process, where each action refers to outputting the next token. Formally, at each time step t , we denote the current state as ( x, o &lt;t ) , where x is the initial prompt and o &lt;t is all previously generated tokens. Then, the conditioned probability distribution of an action is denoted as π θ ( o t | x, o &lt;t ) , where π θ is the policy parameterized by θ . Based on the distribution, we can obtain the next token o t through manual selection, greedy or temperature sampling. Upon obtaining a complete sequence o , termed as a trajectory, a reward function then evaluates and assigns it with a scalar score R that can reflect

user satisfaction or answer correctness. However, using R directly in gradient estimates leads to high variance and unstable updates; instead, the advantage A , which measures how much better an action is than the expected return from that state, is adopted to reduce variance and improve sample efficiency [27, 28, 31, 32].

Sampling and Advantage Computation. Sampling-based advantage estimation is widely adopted in recent advances [27, 31-33]; below we describe its basic pipeline and two typical computation methods. Given an input x , a group of G different trajectories { o i } G i =1 , are sampled from π θ old . Existing studies widely obtain these trajectories via topK sampling with temperature, where θ old refers to the frozen policy parameters before current update. Each trajectory o i receives a scalar reward R i , which will then be used to compute the trajectory-level advantages via two widely adopted approaches, namely GRPO [27] and RLOO [31]:

where ϵ defines the clipping trust-region radius, which prevents excessively large updates, thereby reducing variance and improving optimization stability.

## 3 R 2 ec: Large Recommender Model with Reasoning

R 2 ec is a large recommender model that 'thinks' to recommend. We first outline the model design that enables the incorporation of generative reasoning and discriminative recommendation into a single model in Section 3.1. And then our proposed RL optimization algorithm tailored for achieving unified reasoning and recommendation capabilities is introduced in Section 3.2.

## 3.1 Model Design

Architecture. As illustrated in Figure 1, our proposed R 2 ec is built upon a decoder-only backbone with two task-specific heads: 1) Language-modeling head ( lm\_head ). The token embedding table H T ∈ R |T |× d . Where T is the token set, and each row is a d -dimensional embedding for one token. This head is responsible for the generation of reasoning tokens. 2) Recommendation head ( rec\_head ). The item embedding table H V ∈ R |V|× d . Where V is the item set, and each row h v in H V is obtained by encoding item description prompt into the model itself and extracting the final hidden state. This head is used to score items for recommendation. Such design integrates generative reasoning and discriminative recommendation within a single unified model. It supports flexible and scalable item update by simply adding, deleting, or replacing vectors in the item embedding table, contrasting with generative recommendation systems that require hard-coded tokenization [34, 9, 4, 35], enabling effective zero-shot generalization and accommodating large-scale item catalogs without severe degradation on recommendation quality or efficiency.

Item prediction. Inference begins with feeding the tokenized user prompt x u (template of prompts can be found in Appendix G) into the transformer-based backbone, producing an initial hidden state h 0 . The language-modeling head then maps h 0 to the first reasoning token o 1 . This process continues autoregressively, yielding a sequence of T reasoning tokens o 1: T . The final hidden state of the generated sequence h T is then fed into the recommendation head, where each candidate

item v ∈ V is scored by an inner product s ( v ) = h ⊤ T H V [ v ] , v ∈ V , which determines the final ranking. This mechanism yields a tight reasoning-recommendation coupling, since both the languagemodeling head and recommendation head share the same hidden-state space as input, reasoning directly reshapes h T and thus yielding more accurate recommendation scores s ( v ) . Such alignment ensures that reasoning optimization (Section 3.2) contributes directly to finer recommendation.

## 3.2 Optimization: RecPO

The goal is to train the policy π θ to jointly perform reasoning and recommendation, i.e., it must generate coherent reasoning sequences to rank the target item accurately. Accordingly, we structure our optimization workflow in three parts. 1) we introduce the trajectory sampling strategy that draws multiple reasoning trajectories for each user (Section 3.2.1). 2) we describe reward and advantage estimation , where discrete ranking signals and softmax similarities are fused into a single scalar award for the above sampled trajectories (Section 3.2.2). 3) we formulate the training objective , which blends reasoning-level and recommendation-level updates through a clipped-ratio loss (Section 3.2.3). Complete description of training and inference pipeline are in Appendix E.

## 3.2.1 Trajectory Sampling

Due to the optimization objective of joint learning, we define one trajectory in our settings spanning the entire reasoning-then-recommend process:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the initial state x u encodes the user history and instruction, o 1 , ..., o T represents the intermediate actions of outputing T reasoning tokens, and v + as the action of recommending the ground-truth target item.

For each user u , we first sample G reasonings { o i } G i =1 with the old policy π θ old using the tokenized input x u : { o i } G i =1 ∼ π θ old ( · | x u ) by topK sampling with temperature to control stochasticity. Each sampled reasoning is then fed through the policy π θ to produce a complete reasoning-then-recommend trace, which is subsequently used for reward calculation and advantage estimation.

## 3.2.2 Reward and Advantage Estimation

Given the above sampled trajectories, we now aim to assign rewards to them. Basically, the reward should align with the evaluation criteria, i.e., the recommendation metrics in our work, encouraging the model to achieve better performance. However, in practice, we find that directly using the recommendation metrics as rewards is insufficient, as many trajectories of varying quality can result in the same topK ranking. We therefore introduce a fused reward scheme that combines discrete ranking reward R d and continuous similarity reward R c , which are formulated as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where R d is the NDGC, R c is the softmax similarity of recommending target item against all items in V . The final reward is then obtained through a linear combination:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the weighting coefficient β is empirically set to β ≈ 0 . 05 to keep the ranking term dominant while providing sufficient resolution among trajectories that attain identical ranks. With rewards { R i } G i =1 we can obtain trajectory-level advantages { A i } G i =1 via Eqn.(2).

## 3.2.3 Training Objective

Given the goal of joint optimization of reasoning and recommendation, we treat the entire reasoningthen-recommend sequence ( x u , o 1 , ..., o T , v + ) as a single RL trajectory. Policy optimization therefore operates over a composite action space, where the policy first makes token-level decisions to generate reasoning, then selects an item at the recommendation stage. Under this formulation, the importance ratio from Eqn. (3) extends to:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Specifically, we model the recommending action, i.e., recommending the target item v + via the in-batch softmax:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Let ℓ ϵ ( r, A ) = min( rA, clip( r, 1 -ϵ, 1 + ϵ ) A ) be the standard clipping operator with threshold ϵ , we define the joint reasoning-and-recommendation training objective as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In Eqn.(8), all trajectories contribute to token-level policy updates via the standard clipped objective ℓ ϵ ( r i,t ( θ ) , A i ) . This design ensures the policy continues to learn from diverse reasoning behaviors. For the last recommendation action, only the trajectory with the highest advantage, identified by i ⋆ = arg max j A j , contributes gradients to recommendation optimization. This design concentrates recommendation learning with the most promising reasoning path, while the presence of other G -1 reasoning paths contributes to ample exploration in reasoning actions, thus preserving exploration and ensuring effective recommendation learning. We further provide a gradient-based explanation of how item encoding, as a core component of the model's recommendation ability, participates in the objective and enables end-to-end optimization in Appendix F.

## 4 Experiments

## 4.1 Setups

Dataset and Metrics. Following previous works [3, 2, 1, 25], we conducted experiments using realworld datasets sourced from Amazon, including CDs and Vinyl (CDs), Video Games (Games), and Musical Instruments (Instruments). Dataset statistics and preprocessing steps detailed in Appendix B. We utilized two commonly used metrics: Hit Rate (H@K) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (N@K), with cutoff K set to 5 , 10 and 20 . We adopted the full set recommendation setting, where metrics are computed over the entire item set, providing a better reflection of practical scenarios.

Baselines and Implementation. We selected competitive baselines from various categories, including traditional sequential recommenders (GRU4Rec [36], Caser [37], SASRec [38]), LLM-based recommender (TIGER [9], BigRec [2], D 3 [3], SDPO [25], Llara [1], SPRec [39]), and reasoning augmented recommendation systems (LangPTune [16]). For fair comparison, we adapted LLaRA and SDPO by removing candidate prompts to perform constrained generation over the full item corpus, denoted as LLaRA* and SDPO* respectively. Backboned on Gemma2-2B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct . More baseline and implementation details can be found in Appendix C and D, respectively.

## 4.2 Overall Performance

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed R 2 ec, we showed the overall performance of baselines and our R 2 ec in Table 1. By analyzing the results, we gained the following findings. 1) Overall, R 2 ec consistently outperforms every competing baseline, underscoring the value of jointly optimizing reasoning and recommendation. 2) Traditional methods perform well on the Instruments dataset but struggle on CDs and Games, revealing their limited generality. LangPTune frequently ranks second, which validates the benefit of integrating explicit reasoning into the recommendation pipeline. Finally, large recommenders generally outperform traditional approaches, notably secure secondary position on the Games dataset. We attribute this advantage to their larger model scale and semantic understanding capabilities. 3) Comparing two backbones, Gemma consistently outperforms its larger counterpart, achieving up to 2× gains for D 3 - suggesting that Gemma may generally deliver stronger recommendation performance despite its smaller parameter count (2B vs. 3B).

## 4.3 Ablation Study

We conducted ablation studies by evaluating the following variants: 1) ' w/ ClsHead', an alternative design that uses classification head to the hidden state of reasoning tokens, instead of using the unified

reasoning-recommendation formulation. 2) ' w/o Reasoning', where reasoning tokens are removed from prompts and the model is trained solely with in-batch contrastive loss; 3) ' w/o R c ', which retains only the discrete ranking reward R d while removing the continuous similarity reward R c in Eqn. (5); 4) ' w/o R d ', which removes the discrete ranking reward R d from Eqn. (5); and The results are summarized in Table 2, and several observations stand out.

1) It is found that R 2 ec achieves an average improvement of roughly 15% across all metrics compared to w/o Reasoning. These substantial gains demonstrate that our designed optimization have enabled R 2 ec to better leverage test-time scaling to deliver significantly stronger recommendation performance. 2) The w/ ClsHeadvariant substantially underperforms our tightly-coupled architecture, highlighting the necessity of reasoning-recommendation co-optimization. 3) As revealed that w/o R c (using only R d ) consistently outperforms w/o R d (using only R c ), this indicates that adopting reward signal that directly reflects evaluation result is crucial for training, while the continuous reward R c , despite offering finer granularity, fails to provide meaningful distinctions and instead introduces noise that leads to suboptimal performance. 4) By fusing R d with a small weight on R c , our approach preserves the task alignment of ranking rewards while benefiting from the supplementary signal of the continuous term. As a result, R 2 ec achieves optimal performance on nearly all metrics.

## 4.4 Analysis on Optimization

This subsection presents analyses of key optimization strategies in RecPO, evaluating their impact on final performance.

## 4.4.1 Analysis on Advantage Estimation

Accurate advantage estimation is crucial for reducing variance and improving sample efficiency in policy-gradient RL [31, 28, 32]. We therefore evaluated two estimators, GRPO [40] and RLOO [31],

Figure 2: Analysis on advantage estimation methods, RLOO and GRPO, across two datasets. 'Train Reward' and 'Val Reward' indicate the variation in rewards on the training set and validation set, respectively. 'Val Length' represents the variation in reasoning length on the validation set.

<!-- image -->

in our training pipeline. The variations of the training reward, validation reward, and reasoning length across the training steps are summarized in Figure 2, and we had the following observations.

1) First, as shown in Figure 2a and Figure 2d, both RLOO and GRPO exhibit high-variance training curves. This is due to the inherent nature of recommendation environments, which produce highly varied reward magnitudes-some sessions result in high rankings, while others yield very low ones. 2) Second, as Figure 2b and Figure 2e illustrate, GRPO demonstrates faster learning in the initial training steps and consistently outperforms RLOO in terms of validation reward, whereas RLOO progresses more steadily. This divergence stems from the GRPO's unit-variance normalization magnifies rewards into larger gradients that accelerate early learning. 3) Besides, as shown in Figure 2c and Figure 2f, GRPO's reasoning length gradually increases as training progresses, which is consistent with the phenomenon observed in LLM reasoning training [40], while RLOO appears to maintain a certain level of stability. This is because RLOO-driven optimization does not encourage improved reasoning with the low reward magnitudes in our task.

## 4.4.2 Analysis on Trajectory Sampling

During RecPO, we performed trajectory sampling via the temperature τ and topK sampling, which influence the stochasticity and diversity of the generated samples. To quantify their impact, we varied τ and K , and the results are presented in Figure 3. 1) It is observed that increasing the temperature produces longer resoning and boosts recommendation performance, i.e., , NDCG@5. A higher temperature introduces greater sampling entropy, allowing the model to explore a wider range of reasoning trajectories. 2) Conversely, it is found that increasing topK actually shortens the reasoning length and generally leads to a decline in recommendation performance. This is because a larger topK enlarges the candidate token set, which counterintuitively mitigates length hacking yet excessively large K reintroduces noisy and low-quality samples.

| Method                   |    N@5 |   N@10 |    H@5 |   H@10 |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Special token            | 0.0353 | 0.0432 | 0.0509 | 0.0737 |
| Mean pooling             | 0.0368 | 0.0453 | 0.0528 | 0.0796 |
| Max pooling              | 0.0382 | 0.0445 | 0.0595 | 0.0729 |
| Last hidden state (ours) | 0.0388 | 0.0457 | 0.0588 | 0.0804 |

## 4.4.3 Analysis on Group Size

During RecPO, we sampled a group of trajectories to estimate their advantages. Therefore, we conducted experiments to analyze how varying group sizes impact performance. The results are outlined in Figure 3, and we gained several key findings as follows: 1) It is observed that performance improves for both backbones as group size increases, but the rate of improvement gradually slows down. While a larger group size generally leads to more explored paths, it also raises the training cost. These results suggest that selecting a group size of 6 or 8 is sufficient, and further increasing the group size is unnecessary. 2) Comparing the two backbones, we found a difference in sensitivity to group size. Qwen's performance at a group size of 1 lags significantly behind Gemma's, but it improves rapidly as the group size increases. Gemma performs well even with smaller groups, likely because its pretraining exposed it to a broader range of reasoning scenarios, thereby equipping it with stronger initial reasoning-for-recommendation capabilities.

## 4.4.4 Analysis on Embedding Strategy

We further examined different strategies for obtaining sequence-level embeddings. Specifically, we compared the last hidden state used in R 2 ec against max pooling, mean pooling, and adding a special-token under identical settings. As reported in Table 3, the last hidden state yields the best overall performance. Special token strategies yield weaker performance in our setting, likely because we adopt LoRA fine-tuning and no large-scale optimization on the LLLM backbone; it is thus challenging for the model to effectively learn to generate and utilize newly introduced tokens for global sequence representation.

## 4.5 Analysis on Reasoning Behavior : How Does R 2 ec Reason to Recommend?

How exactly does R 2 ec transform raw behavioral descriptions into insightful recommendations? While the previous sections establish that reasoning substantially enhances recommendation accuracy, the underlying decision process-how the model internally reasons to reach its conclusions-remains less understood. To demystify this process, we conduct a systematic qualitative and quantitative analysis to uncover the reasoning strategies R 2 ec employs across different domains and user contexts.

Qualitative Analysis. We first engaged in extensive discussions with colleagues to collaboratively analyze and summarize the diverse reasoning behaviors exhibited by R 2 ec. Through this process, we identified seven distinct reasoning strategies of R 2 ec for recommendation:

1. Attribute Abstraction: Identifying underlying attributes of purchased items.
2. Pattern Recognition &amp; Clustering: Detecting frequent item patterns to form user-interest clusters.
3. Scenario/Role-Based Reasoning: Inferring user roles or specific use cases.
4. Temporal Reasoning: Leveraging purchase timing and order for contextual understanding.
5. Self-Explanation: Providing explicit rationales for recommendations.
6. Negative Preference Exclusion: Avoiding previously negatively rated item types.
7. Multi-Objective Balancing: Managing trade-offs between conflicting user objectives.

These reasoning strategies illustrate how reasoning aids recommendation. Equipped with reasoning, large recommender models can distill salient user preferences from noisy or complex behavioral data, abstract beyond surface-level co-occurrence, and produce more contextually appropriate and interpretable recommendations.

Quantitative Analysis. Building on the above findings, we then randomly sampled 100 reasoning outputs from each test set. These samples were annotated and analyzed through a combination of detailed human evaluation and automated assessment with GPT-4.1, ensuring both depth and consistency. Figure 4 visualizes the proportion of sampled reasoning outputs within each dataset that exhibit

Figure 4: Distribution of reasoning behaviors across datasets. Each bar represents the proportion of reasoning outputs exhibiting a given reasoning behavior within a dataset.

each reasoning behavior, which reveals two key trends. (1) The distribution of reasoning behaviors varies across datasets, indicating that R 2 ec self-adapts its reasoning patterns to domain characteristics and user-item interactions. (2) Even within a single domain, R 2 ec flexibly selects different reasoning strategies depending on the specific user sequence. Overall, these results demonstrate that R 2 ec does not follow a fixed reasoning template but instead employs context-aware reasoning tailored to both dataset and user, yielding improved recommendation performance and interpretability.

## 4.6 Analysis on Inference Efficiency

To quantify the efficiency gains of our unified model R 2 ec over both traditional and LLM-based recommenders, we conducted comparative latency tests. All inferences were performed on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU using identical input prompts, maximum token lengths, and candidate sets. We executed 100 queries per run at a batch size of 1 and averaged the results over 3 independent runs.

As shown in Table 4, 1) R 2 ec achieves competitive inference efficiency among LLM-based recommenders, outperforming comparable methods such as LangPTune, D 3 , and LLaRA. Such benefits stem from the use of scalable item embeddings, which avoid expensive autoregressive decoding over large item vocabularies and the design of an unified architecture. 2) When deployed with the VLLM

Table 4: Average inference latency (in seconds) across models.

| Method             |   Latency (s) |
|--------------------|---------------|
| SASRec             |        0.014  |
| LangPTune          |        1.9    |
| D 3                |        4.62   |
| LLaRA              |        5.23   |
| R 2 ec             |        1.67   |
| R 2 ec (with VLLM) |        0.0945 |

inference framework, R 2 ec significantly narrowed the efficiency gap with traditional sequential models like SASRec. These results demonstrate that R 2 ec successfully balances expressive power and computational efficiency.

## 4.7 More Analysis

Due to space constraints, further extended analyses on Scaling to Larger Backbones and CrossDomain Robustness are reported in Appendix I, while Appendix J provides representative case studies . We also discuss the limitations of our approach in Appendix H.

## 5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this study, we investigate the integration of reasoning into large recommender models by introducing R 2 ec, a unified large recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capabilities, trained with RecPO, without reliance on human-annotated reasoning annotations. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrated that R 2 ecachieves both higher recommendation quality and lower inference latency compared to existing reasoning-augmented and conventional LLM-based recommenders. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of tightly coupling reasoning and recommendation to unlock large recommender model's full potential. In the future, we aim to further investigate the efficient reasoning in larger recommender models, striving for optimal 'thinking' in recommendations.

## NeurIPS Paper Checklist

## 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The contributions and scope of the paper are included in the abstract and Section 1. Please refer to the first and last paragraph of Section 1 for scope and contributions, respectively.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

## 2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Limitations of our work is detailed in Appendix H.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

## 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

## 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We introduce the details of the experiment, including hardware, software and other curtail settings in Appendix D.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

## 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have attached the data and code used in this paper in the supplementary material.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so 'No' is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We introduce the data splits in Appendix B, hyperparameters, optimizers in Appendix D, with crucial hyperparameter study in Sec. 4.4.2.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

## 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report the two-sided t-test with p &lt; 0.05 results in the main experiments.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
- The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

- The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
- It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

## 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the details of compute resources in the implementation detail in Appendix D.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

## 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have made sure that our paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

## 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the potential positive impacts that our algorithm will bring in the Introduction section.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

- Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
- The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

## 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: There is no risk of misuse of the proposed method and the datasets used in the paper are open-sourced.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

## 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

## 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects. Guidelines:

## A Related Work

## A.1 Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning

OpenAI's GPT-o1 demonstrated that scaling reinforcement learning (RL) training with large compute budgets enables models to internalize reasoning as a differentiable policy, achieving state-of-theart performance in emergent meta-reasoning tasks [41]. Early RLHF methods trained a reward model on human preference data and fine-tuned the policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [28]; however, PPO's multiple optimization passes introduce implementation complexity. To streamline RL tuning, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [42] performs single-step policy updates, trading simplicity for potential off-policy bias. Alternative estimators, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [27], derive baselines from group-level rewards, eliminating the need for a separate critic, while REINFORCE's leave-one-out (RLOO) [31] computes advantages by excluding each trajectory sequentially. Building on these advancements, DeepSeek-Zero [40] removes reliance on supervised fine-tuning by driving reasoning emergence purely through intrinsic RL rewards, and DeepSeek-R1 further integrates rule-driven reward engineering with self-play verification to enhance reasoning robustness.

## A.2 Large Language Model-based Recommendation

Recommendation systems are a cornerstone of modern information services [43, 44], and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising frontier to advance their capabilities [45, 2, 46]. Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation typically follow two paradigms: 1) LLM-enhanced, where LLMs enrich recommendation pipelines with additional features, and 2) LLM-centric, where recommendation is framed as a generative task via item identifiers [1-4, 24-26], or LLMs serve as encoders to embed users and items [7, 29]. We term models under the second paradigm as large recommender models. In the first paradigm, LLM-generated embeddings are utilized to enhance conventional recommenders. Adoption of LLM-generated text are not new, typical examples includes user intent [16, 47], search queries [21], item summaries [19], or rationales [23]. Among them, SLIM [23], LangPTune [16], and Rec-R1 [21] further optimize LLM for finer rationale generation with RL. However, such designs introduce high resource demands for training and serving both models, and the connection between two modules remains gradient-less, blocking true end-toend learning, resulting in suboptimal convergence and performance. Large recommender models typically recommend through autoregressive generation of item identifiers [4, 24] or titles [1-3, 25], or by embedding user interaction sequences [7, 29]. Large recommender model has demonstrated remarkable potential, but current methods fail to utilize reasoning ability of LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, no existing large recommender model improves recommendation over explicit reasoning generation, which is the gap that motivated our work.

Following the temporal-truncation protocol introduced in previous literature [3, 2], we construct three subsetsCDs and Vinyl (CDs), Video Games (Games), and Musical Instruments (Instruments) from the lastest public Amazon review dataset 2 spanning from May 1996 to October 2023. For each domain, we begin with the most recent year of interactions (October 2022 - October 2023) and, if the resulting number of valid items is insufficient, iteratively roll the time window backward monthby-month until 10k items are obtained. We omit the 5-core filter so as to retain the nature behaviour characteristic of recommendation scenarios. Each user's interaction history is then chronologically sorted and truncated to the latest 20 actions , yielding fixed-length sequences for all subsequent

## D Implementation Details

- Hardware: 4x NVIDIA 3090 (24GB) GPUs
- Framework: PyTorch 2.5.0, Transformers 4.48.1, DeepSpeed 0.15.7

Traditional Recommenders. We train all non-LLM baselines with the Cross-Entropy loss and the AdamW optimiser (learning-rate 1 × 10 -4 ); the batch size is 256. TIGER [9] adopts T5 as its backbone without further architectural changes.

LLM-based Methods. For every LLM variant - including the contrastive-learning baseline ( CL , Section 4.3) - we finetune Gemma2-2B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct . Models are adapted with LoRA (rank = 4) using DeepSpeed Stage 2 and the quantized PagedAdamW optimizer. Training lasts for at most three epochs with early stopping (patience = 1); the maximum generation length is 512 tokens. If public implementations exist, we keep the original hyper-parameters; otherwise, a grid search over learning rates { 5 × 10 -4 , 1 × 10 -4 } is performed.

R 2 ec (ours). The learning rate is set as 1 e -5 with a batch size of 24, and apply linear warm-up for the first 32 steps. For trajectory generation, we set the group size G as four, utilized VLLM 3 (tensor-parallelism = 1, target GPU utilisation = 95 %) for efficient generation. VLLM reserves one GPU for inference and leaves three for training. Sampling uses temperature = 1.5 and topK = 200. Policy optimization follows the clipping ratio ϵ = 0 . 2 and omits KL regularization. Rewards are computed with NDCG @1000 and β = 0 . 05 . Unless stated otherwise, these settings are used throughout.

## E Overall Pipeline

Training To instantiate R 2 ec, given the dataset D , the initial policy π θ , and item embedding cache H V , we train the model with detailed training process illustrated in Algorithm 1.

3 https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/

## Algorithm 1 Training Process

```
Input: Dataset D , initial policy π θ , embedding function f θ , item embedding table H V Output: Optimized policy model π θ 1: for step = 1 to N do 2: if step % T refresh == 0 then 3: Refresh item embedding: H V [ v ] ← f θ ( x v ) , ∀ v ∈ V 4: end if 5: Sample a training batch B = { ( u, v + ) } ∼ D 6: Encode target item prompts and update embedding table: H V [ v + ] ← f θ ( x v + ) ∀ ( u, v + ) ∈ B 7: for all ( u, v + ) in B do 8: Generate G trajectory: { [ o 1 , v + ] ..., [ o G , v + ] } ∼ π θ old ( ·| x u ) 9: Compute reward for each trajectory using Eq. (5) 10: Compute advantage for each trajectory using Eq. (2) 11: end for 12: Update policy parameters θ via loss in Eq. (8) 13: Update old policy: θ old ← θ 14: end for
```

Inference For inference, we first pass every item prompt x v through the trained model once to obtain all item embeddings H V . At inference time, the model greedily generates a deterministic reasoning o for a user prompt x u , the last hidden state h T goes through the embedding table, scoring each candidate via the inner product s ( v ) = h ⊤ T H V [ v ] . The topK items can then be recommended by sorting these scores.

## F Gradient Explanation for End-to-End Optimization

We explain how R 2 ec achieves end-to-end optimization by analyzing gradient flow during training, where the recommendation signal propagates through both the reasoning trajectory and the live item encoding process.

During training, each item v is encoded on the fly by the model as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

so that both the reasoning trajectory producing h T and the item embeddings h v depend on the same evolving computation rather than on static class weights.

At the recommendation step, the model predicts the ground-truth item v + via

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and optimizes the policy objective for the highest-advantage trajectory i ⋆ :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The corresponding gradient is

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

which expands to

The second component, h ⊤ T ∇ θ f θ ( x v ′ ) , shows that gradients flow directly into the item encoding process. Hence, updates from the recommendation signal not only refine the reasoning trajectory that produces h T , but also reshape the item embedding function f θ , aligning the semantic encoding of items with the reasoning space.

## G Prompt

As illustrated in Figure 5, user interaction histories and item metadata are serialized into token sequences via the given prompt templates. To signal the boundary between reasoning and recommendation, we introduce control symbol &lt;answer&gt; , which triggers a shift from language modeling head to recommendation head.

## H Limitations

Our work acknowledges two primary limitations. First, introducing explicit reasoning generation inevitably increases inference latency and reduces efficiency due to additional autoregressive decoding steps; nevertheless, exploring the potential of reasoning within recommendation is valuable, and our experiments have empirically confirmed its effectiveness in improving recommendation accuracy. Second, constrained by computational resources, we employed parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) rather than full-parameter fine-tuning, thus not fully demonstrating the potentially superior performance achievable through comprehensive optimization.

## I Extended Analysis

Scaling to Larger Backbones. We further scale R 2 ec to Gemma-9B-it . The results in Table 6 confirm that reasoning consistently improves recommendation across model sizes, and the absolute gain grows with scale (21.7% higher N@5 than its non-reasoning counterpart).

Cross-Domain Robustness. To further assess generalization to new domains, we extended our evaluation to the Electronics, MovieLens, and GoodReads datasets, and compared R 2 ec with advanced baselines, as shown in Tables 6a, 6c, and 6b, respectively. R 2 ec consistently surpasses prior methods,

```
User Prompt Analyze in depth and finally recommend next {category} I might purchase inside <answer> and </answer> . For example, <answer> a product </answer> . Below is my historical {category} purchases and ratings (out of 5): {% for hist in purchase_histories %} {% {hist.time_delta} ago: [ {hist.item_title} ] ( {hist.rating} ) %} Item Prompt Summarize key attributes of the following {category} inside <answer> and </answer> : {% for key, attr in item.meta %} {% {key} : {attr} %}
```

Figure 5: Prompt templates for user interaction history and item metadata. The User Prompt encodes a user's past purchases as a sequence of item titles, relative timestamps (e.g., '2hrs', '4d'), and explicit ratings (in [1 , 5] ), followed by an instruction to analyze and recommend the next item within the span of &lt;/answer&gt; and &lt;/answer&gt; . The Item Prompt summarizes structured item attributes (e.g., brand, type, features) with the same format requirement.

demonstrating the robustness of reasoning-enhanced recommendation across diverse domains and evaluation settings.

## J Analysis on Case Study

To illustrate domain-specific and backbone-specific reasoning behaviors, we analyze representative cases from the CDs and Video Games datasets (Figures 7, 8, 9, 10) using Gemma and Qwen as backbones. 1) On the CDs dataset, both models tend to reason by discussing several potentially interesting items and explicitly enumerating their features and genres, before providing a final recommendation. This behavior highlights the models' ability to leverage domain knowledge acquired during pretraining and reinforced through RecPO, for better recommendation. 2) On the Video Games dataset, the models shift towards inferring user intent from the purchase sequence, speculating on the likely category or intended use of the next purchase. This demonstrates a shift from feature-based enumeration to intent-driven reasoning as the domain changes. 3) Notably, Gemma generally produces shorter and more concise reasoning sequences compared to Qwen, which often generates more elaborate justifications. These patterns indicate that, while both models benefit from explicit reasoning, their generation style and reliance on pretrained knowledge can manifest differently across domains and backbone choices.
