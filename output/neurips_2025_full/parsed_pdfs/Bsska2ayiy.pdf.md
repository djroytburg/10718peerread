## Abstract

Advances in image generation technologies have raised growing concerns about their potential misuse, particularly in producing misinformation and deepfakes. This creates an urgent demand for effective methods to detect AI-generated images (AIGIs). While progress has been made, achieving reliable performance across diverse generative models and scenarios remains challenging due to the absence of source-invariant features and the limited generalization of existing approaches. In this study, we investigate the potential of using image entropy as a discriminative cue for AIGI detection and propose Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of feature maps computed based on Shannon entropy from shuffled small patches at multiple image scales. MLEP effectively captures pixel dependencies across scales and dimensions while disrupting semantic content, thereby reducing potential content bias. Based on MLEP, we can easily build a robust CNNbased classifier capable of detecting AIGIs with enhanced reliability. Extensive experiments in an open-world setting, involving images synthesized by 32 distinct generative models, demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization. Our code and models are available at https://www.github.com/fkeufss/MLEP/ .

## 1 Introduction

The rapid development of generative technologies has transformed image synthesis, with models like GAN [1], diffusion model [2], and their variants achieving impressive realism. While enabling new applications in creative industries, these advancements have also raised concerns over misuse in misinformation and deepfakes [3, 4], prompting an urgent need for reliable AI-generated image (AIGI) detection methods. Researchers have leveraged spatial [5, 6, 7, 8] and frequency-domain cues [9, 10, 11, 12], as well as high-level knowledge from pretrained diffusion models [13, 14] and LLMs [15, 16, 17] for AIGI detection. Yet, the lack of source-invariant representations still limits the cross-domain detection robustness, especially when across different models and content types.

To address this challenge, we aim to identify a generalized, content-agnostic pattern that can reliably distinguish AIGIs from real photographs. Inspired by recent studies [7, 8], our work builds on two key observations. Tan et al.[7] found that generative models typically involve internal upsampling operations and propose Neighboring Pixel Relationships (NPR) to capture resulting structural artifacts. However, NPR operates on small local patches and retains visible semantic structures, introducing bias that may hinder generalization. Zheng et al.[8] emphasized the impact of 'semantic artifacts' on detection and propose disrupting image semantics by shuffling 32 × 32 patches. While this improves

cross-scene generalization, the relatively large patch size still preserves semantic information. We argue that such artifacts persist and continue to limit content-agnostic detection.

Through large-scale subjective observation, we noticed a distinct 'glossy and smooth' texture in AI-generated images, prompting an investigation into their entropy characteristics, a statistical measure of pixel randomness [18]. We conducted a preliminary study comparing local entropy distributions (using 2 × 2 patches) between real and AI-generated images. As shown in Fig. 1, real images consistently exhibit a higher probability of maximum entropy (2.0), suggesting the potential of entropy as a discriminative feature for AIGI detection. Motivated by this, we propose using image entropy as an alternative to pixel differences as proposed by NPR [7]. Entropy captures pixel relationships while reducing semantic dependency by focusing on pixel value distributions rather than contrasts. To further suppress semantic artifacts, we adopt fine-grained patch shuffling (smaller than the 32 × 32 patches used in [8]), which also reduces the computational overhead of entropy computation. Additionally, we incorporate multi-scale resampling and an overlapping sliding window to enhance the granularity of entropy patterns. Our contributions are summarized as follows:

- To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to explore the potential of image entropy as a cue for detecting AI-generated images. Using image entropy not only enhances detection accuracy and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods but also highlights intrinsic differences between real and AI-generated images in terms of pixel randomness, as quantified by image entropy.
- We propose M ulti-granularity L ocal E ntropy P atterns ( MLEP ), a set of feature maps with entropy computed from shuffled small patches across multiple resampling scales. MLEP effectively disrupts image semantics to mitigate content bias, while capturing pixel relationships across both spatial and scale dimensions. Using MLEP as input, a standard CNN classifier can be trained for robust and generalized AIGI detection.
- Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses validate the effectiveness of the MLEP design, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across multiple AI-generated image datasets.

## 2 Related Work

Spatial-domain Detection Spatial-domain methods typically rely on handcrafted spatial features, local patterns, or pixel statistics to distinguish between real and generated images. The representative methods include generalized feature extraction from CNN-based model [5] and inter-pixel correlation between rich and poor texture regions [6]. Tan et al. [7] observed that upsampling operations are prevalent in image generation models and proposed utilizing neighboring pixel relationships (NPR), computed through local pixel differences, as a simple yet effective cue for AIGI detection. Zheng et al. [8] discovered that image semantic information negatively impacts detection performance and proposed a simple linear classifier that utilizes image patch shuffling to disrupt the original semantic artifacts. Cozzolino et al. [19] proposed a zero-shot detection method that models the distribution of real images using lossless coding with multi-resolution prediction, identifying AI-generated images by detecting higher-than-expected coding costs that indicate deviations from real-image

statistics. Yang et al. [20] proposed Discrepancy Deepfake Detector (D 3 ), which enhances crossgenerator generalization by introducing a parallel branch that extracts a discrepancy signal from distorted features to complement the original representation, achieving better robustness without compromising in-domain performance.

Frequency-domain Detection To tackle the subtlety of spatial artifacts in AI-generated images, frequency-domain methods analyze image frequency components, enabling more effective real vs. fake differentiation. The study in [9] found that GAN-generated images exhibit generalized artifacts in discrete cosine transform (DCT) spectrum, which can be readily identified. Qian et al. [10] proposed a face forgery detection network based on frequency-aware decomposed image components and local frequency statistics. Luo et al. [11] proposed a feature representation based on high-frequency noise at multiple scales and enhanced detection performance by integrating it with an attention module. Liu et al. [12] utilized noise patterns in the frequency domain as feature representations for detecting AI-generated images. Tan et al. [21] proposed FreqNet toward detection generalizability, which focuses on high-frequency components of images, exploiting high-frequency representation across spatial and channel dimension.

Detection leveraging Pretrained Models This group of methods aims to derive generalized features for AIGI detection by leveraging the knowledge learned by large models pretrained on extensive datasets. Wang et al. [13] proposed an artifact representation named DIffusion Reconstruction Error (DIRE), which obtains the difference between the input image and its reconstructed object through a pretrained diffusion model. Chen et al. [14] proposed utilizing pretrained diffusion models to generate high-quality synthesized images, serving as challenging samples to enhance the detector's performance. Ojha et al. [15] utilized representations from a fixed pretrained CLIP model as generalized features for detection. Chen et al. [22] introduced ForgeLens, a data-efficient CLIP-ViT framework that enhances generalization to unseen forgeries by using proposed lightweight weight shared guidance module (WSGM) and forgery-aware feature integrator (FAFormer) to guide frozen features toward forgery-relevant information. Zhang et al. [23] proposed VIB-Net, which employs variational information bottlenecks to enforce authentication task-related feature learned from pretrained CLIP encoder, significantly improving generalization across different generative model types. Similar methods such as [16, 17] also leveraged textual information from vision-language models to further enhance detection performance.

## 3 The Approach

The proposed approach leverages entropy-based feature extraction to analyze local pixel randomness in a multi-granularity, semantic-agnostic manner. It begins by dividing the image into small patches and applying random shuffling to reduce semantic bias. A multi-scale pyramid is then constructed by downsampling and upsampling the scrambled image, introducing resampling artifacts. Local entropy is computed using a 2 × 2 sliding window across the entire image, capturing complexity across intra-block, inter-block, and inter-scale levels. The resulting multi-granularity local entropy patterns (MLEP) are used as input to a standard CNN classifier for distinguishing AI-generated from real images. An overview of the method is shown in Fig. 2, with key components detailed below.

## 3.1 Semantic Suppression via Patch Shuffling

Inspired by previous work [6, 8] that mitigates semantic bias via patch-based processing, we adopt finer patch shuffling to further disrupt image content. Given an input image X ∈ R H × W × C , we first partition it into patches of uniform size of L × L :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where L is a small integer (typically &lt; 8 ), and H,W are assumed divisible by L . The patches are then randomly permuted, resulting in a visually scrambled image denoted as ˜ X :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where π is a bijection defining the patch permutation. Note that partitioning and shuffling are applied independently to each color channel.

Figure 2: Illustration of AI-generated image detection using multi-granularity local entropy patterns (MLEP), which involves three core steps to obtain the MLEP feature: Patch Shuffling, Multi-Scale Resampling, and Local Entropy Pattern computation. The resulting MLEP features are then fed into a CNN-based classifier (e.g., ResNet) to effectively identify AI-generated images.

## 3.2 Multi-Scale Resampling

Inspired by [7] showing that generative models often use upsampling to produce high-resolution outputs, we propose detecting generation artifacts via multi-scale analysis. We hypothesize that resampling generated images reveals distinctive patterns useful for detection. To this end, we first construct a multi-scale pyramid by resampling the scrambled image ˜ X with scale factors S = { s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s K } , with each scale s k ∈ (0 , 1] applied using an interpolation function Down( · , s k ) :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

which are then upsampled back to its original shape using an interpolation function Up( · , H, W ) :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The resulting multi-scale resampling image ˆ X is created by concatenating all the upsampled images along the channel dimension:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## 3.3 Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns

The core of our approach is the design of Local Entropy Patterns (LEP), which quantify textural randomness using a 2 × 2 sliding window over pixel sets ˆ X i,j = { x m,n } m ∈{ i,i +1 } ,n ∈{ j,j +1 } , based on Shannon's definition of information entropy [18]:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where p ( x m,n ) represents the probability of occurrence of the pixel value x m,n within that specific patch ˆ X i,j . By restricting the sliding window to 2 × 2 (four pixels), entropy values are confined to five discrete levels: V = { 0 , 0 . 8 , 1 . 0 , 1 . 5 , 2 } , as shown in Fig. 3c. The proof and an efficient computation algorithm for LEP on a 2 × 2 window are provided in the supplementary material. With a stride of 1, the 2 × 2 sliding window introduces overlap in LEP computation. Due to patch shuffling, this captures both intra-patch and inter-patch entropy-reflecting local randomness within and across original image regions-as illustrated in Fig. 3b. Applied across multiple scales, LEP further captures inter-scale entropy, forming the basis of the final Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP).

Given the computed MLEP feature maps denoted as ¯ X ∈ V ( H -1) × ( W -1) × ( C · K ) , a representative CNN-based classifier can be trained to differentiate between photographic and AI-generated images. Denoting the classifier as f , the training objective is defined using the binary cross-entropy loss:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where y i represents the true labels, f ( ¯ X i ) the predictions, and N the number of training samples.

ResNet-50 backbone, which yield the optimal validation results. MLEP consistently achieves top performance across most datasets. Remarkably, it generalizes well to diffusion-generated images, despite being trained solely on GAN-based data (ProGAN [24]). Even on datasets with entirely different content (e.g., face-centric sets like StarGAN, InfoMaxGAN, and AttGAN), MLEP maintains strong performance, underscoring its cross-scene robustness. Table 3 further shows that MLEP outperforms NPR [7], with average gains of 3.1% in Acc. and 1.6% in A.P., despite NPR's already strong results.

## 4.3 Ablation Study

We next conducted a series of ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of key components and hyperparameters in the proposed approach.

Effectiveness of patch shuffling and multi-scale resampling We first assessed the impact of two key components: patch shuffling and multiscale resampling. Ablation results in Table 4 show that removing either component noticeably reduces performance, with patch shuffling contributing more. Even without both, LEP alone achieves over 94.3% accuracy, higher than NPR (94.0%) [7], highlighting the effectiveness of entropybased features.

Impact of the resampling interpolation method We also evaluated the impact of interpolation methods, comparing bilinear, bicubic, and nearestneighbor (Table 5). Bilinear outperforms nearest-neighbor and performs comparably to bicubic. This might be because bilinear and bicubic blend neighboring pixel values, introducing richer entropy variations, while

nearest-neighbor simply copies pixel values, resulting in limited entropy diversity.

Impact of patch size and scale factors We further examined the effects of patch size and resampling scales by testing different hyperparameter settings, as shown in Table 6. The best performance was achieved with the smallest patch size ( l = 2 ), indicating that stronger semantic scrambling improves detection. Moderate multi-scale fusion ( S = { 1 , 1 / 2 , 1 / 4 } ) also led to optimal results, confirming the benefit of in-

corporating resampling artifacts.

Impact of sliding window stride We evaluated the effect of stride in the 2 × 2 sliding window for LEP computation, testing strides of 1 and 2 (Table 7). A stride of 1 significantly outperforms 2, highlighting the importance of interblock entropy in MLEP. This supports our multigranularity design, which captures both intraand inter-block texture patterns as depicted in Fig. 3.

Compatibility with various backbones Lastly, we assessed the compatibility of MLEP with various ResNet backbones [50], including ResNet-18, 34, 50, and 101. As shown in Table 8, all variants achieved strong performance, with slight gains from larger models. This confirms the generality and scalability of the proposed feature extraction method.

Influence of generation model's text prompts In text-to-image diffusion models, the specificity of input prompts may greatly affect the visual quality and details of generated images. To inspect the influence of text prompts on AIGI detection performance, we conducted an additional experiment using DiffusionDB[51], a large dataset with 14 million Stable Diffusion images generated from 1.8 million unique prompts. We randomly selected two subsets of 3,000 images, one set generated from complex prompts (over 200 characters with keywords like 'high quality,' 'detailed,' and 'realistic') and the other from simple prompts (under 100 characters and without those keywords). We evaluated our trained detector on both subsets and found almost no difference in detection accuracy: 99.65% accuracy on the simple set and 99.62% accuracy on the complex set. This further demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed method over different types of AI-generated content.

## 4.4 Interpretability of MLEP

To illustrate the effectiveness of MLEP for AIGI detection, we conducted a set of qualitative analysis detailed as follows.

Entropy patterns between real and AI-generated images We first visualize LEP maps for several real-fake image pairs, along with their differences in the pixel, entropy, and Fourier domains. Here, 'fake' refers to AI-reconstructed images resembling the originals. Since LEP values are sparse and capped at 2 , we normalize them to [0 , 255] for visualization. As shown in Fig. 4, LEP differences are

far more pronounced than pixel-level differences, especially for high-quality generations like Stable Diffusion v2, where pixel differences are visually negligible. In the frequency domain, real-fake differences show more consistent patterns than in the pixel space, supporting content-agnostic detection. These results highlight LEP's ability to amplify real-fake discrepancies while minimizing semantic interference.

Semantic suppression capability of MLEP We further examine the semantic suppression capability of MLEP compared to two competitive methods: Zheng [8] and NPR [7]. Fig.5 visualizes feature maps of LEP and MLEP (without multi-scale resampling), alongside those from Zheng [8] and NPR [7]. The 32 × 32 shuffled patches in Zheng[8] still retain noticeable semantic cues both locally and globally. NPR [7] produces edge-like features by computing pixel differences, leaving much of the original semantics intact. In contrast, LEP substantially suppresses semantic content by highlighting pixel-level randomness, and MLEP further eliminates it through fine-grained patch shuffling, enabling learning content-agnostic representation for AIGI detection.

Feature distribution of real and AI-generated images Finally, Fig.6 visualizes the t-SNE distribution [52] of real and fake samples based on the final feature layer of a ResNet-50 classifier, comparing our method with two competitive baselines-NPR [7] and FreqNet [21]-which also use ResNet-50. We showcase results on four generative models: StarGAN [30], AttGAN [32], ADM [43], and SDv2 [44]. The proposed local entropy patterns (LEP) achieve noticeably cleaner real-fake separation than the baselines, and MLEP further enhances this distinction, demonstrating stronger discriminative capability for AIGI detection.

## 5 Conclusion and Limitations

This paper explores the use of entropy as a cue for detecting AI-generated images (AIGI) and introduces Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of entropy-based feature maps derived from shuffled small patches across multiple image scales. MLEP captures pixel relationships across spatial and scale dimensions while disrupting image semantics, thereby mitigating content bias. Using MLEP as input, a CNN-based classifier (e.g., ResNet) achieves robust and highly generalizable detection performance.

Limitations Nonetheless, limitations still remain. The paper does not explicitly address the robustness of the detector under common image post-processing operations. In fact, when applying different levels of JPEG compression, blurring, or noise, we observe a 17% to 45% drop in detection accuracy-performance that is less satisfactory compared to methods explicitly optimized for robustness. This limitation stems from the fact that MLEP was not specifically designed to handle such transformations, and no special data augmentation techniques were employed during training. Instead, the paper is focused on exploring the potential of using information entropy as a discriminative signal for AIGI detection and on revealing the intrinsic differences in local entropy patterns between real and AI-generated images. Interestingly, the proposed method shows strong robustness to image rescaling: when images are downsampled to half their original resolution, the mean detection accuracy remains above 92.4% (only 4.7% drop). We attribute this to the multi-scale resampling strategy used during training, which effectively introduced resolution variability as a form of implicit data augmentation. Moreover, entropy is computed only within small 2 × 2 windows, as using larger windows would exponentially increase computational complexity. In the future, more efforts could be devoted to improve the robustness and computation efficiency of entropy-based approach.

## NeurIPS Paper Checklist

## 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The abstract and introduction can accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

## 2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the conclusion section, we discussed the technical limitations and possible future directions of this work.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

## 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

## Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In this work, we not only present a complete implementation framework but also validate our hypothesis through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

## 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We detail all experimental settings, including parameters and configurations, to ensure reproducibility. The code will be publicly released upon acceptance of the paper.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

## 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The entire source code and datasets for training and testing will be publicly released upon acceptance of the paper.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so 'No' is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

## 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the paper, the datasets, hyperparameter selection, and optimizer selection are provided.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

## 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: This study focuses on average detection performance measured by accuracy, with results reported per dataset. Therefore, including error bars is not strictly necessary.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

- The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
- The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
- It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

## 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Section 4 provides details on the computing resources used in the experiments, including GPU type and memory specifications.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

## 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes. The research fully complies with all provisions of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

## 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The introduction outlines the social issues this work aims to address and its potential positive impact, while the conclusion discusses its limitations.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
- Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
- The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

## 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Not applicable. Our dataset contains only public, non-sensitive images with CC licenses, and the model has no risk.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

## 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes. All third-party assets (code, data, models) are explicitly credited with original sources.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
- The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
- The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
- The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

- For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
- If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
- For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
- If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

## 13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

## 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

## 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

- Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
- We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
- For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

## 16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.
- Please refer to our LLM policy ( https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM ) for what should or should not be described.
