## Abstract

Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning. Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/basiclab/DiffusionDRO.

## 1 Introduction

Text-to-image diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful class of generative models, achieving impressive results in synthesizing high-fidelity images from textual descriptions [37, 27, 33, 5, 32, 22]. These models use iterative denoising to progressively transform random noise into coherent visuals aligned with the input text [13]. Despite their capabilities, users often expect outputs that not only match the text but also reflect implicit aesthetic or stylistic preferences that are hard to encode explicitly. As a result, aligning these models with nuanced human preferences has become an emerging challenge.

Existing approaches to preference alignment in generative models have predominantly relied on reinforcement learning frameworks, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [6, 2, 9, 3, 16, 28]. In these methods, models are fine-tuned using reward signals derived from human evaluations, often requiring paired datasets where one output is deemed better than another. Methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have been employed in large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to optimize for human preferences effectively [30, 35, 24].

However, the necessity for paired comparative data introduces substantial practical limitations. Collecting this data is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and it might not encompass the full spectrum of user preferences, potentially omitting users' favored choices. Moreover, even when successfully obtained, paired data may not effectively optimize for user preferences. For example, differentiating between two high-quality options may not yield meaningful insights for preference

determination, as both already meet the desired criteria. Conversely, comparing two poor examples fails to provide the model with positive references needed to avoid undesirable features. In both cases, the comparative data may be too limited to enable the model to discern and learn the nuances that truly align with human preferences, potentially resulting in inconsistent or suboptimal outputs.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for fine-tuning diffusion models to optimize user preferences using only demonstration examples-images that embody the desired qualities-without comparing them to less preferred outputs. This method departs from traditional approaches reliant on paired data, where examples are ranked against each other. Instead, we use these positive examples as direct guides, teaching the model to produce outputs that reflect the desired attributes. By theoretically deriving a novel optimization objective, we enable the diffusion model to learn from these demonstration examples while mitigating the risk of overfitting.

The contributions can be summarized as follows.

- Weintroduce a novel framework for preference optimization in diffusion models that requires expert demonstrations only, addressing the limitations of methods that depend on paired comparative data.
- We derive an optimization objective that compares the model's outputs with the demonstration examples. This formulation ensures effective learning from positive examples while preventing overfitting.
- Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves a preference rate exceeding 70% in terms of PickScore compared to state-of-the-art models. Our approach not only better aligns with desired human preferences but also exhibits robustness and strong generalization to unseen data.

## 2 Related Work

To guide diffusion models toward preferred outcomes, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely adopted, including DDPO [3] and TDPO-R [42], which apply REINFORCE to optimize generation trajectories based on human feedback. However, these methods often suffer from complex reward design and high variance, leading to unstable training [8]. To address these challenges, Fan et al. [9] propose DPOK, introducing a KL divergence term to penalize deviation from the base model and prevent reward hacking [10]. Similarly, PRDP [8] uses a distillation-like strategy where a reward model predicts preferences to guide diffusion model updates, though it remains reliant on the reward model's accuracy.

Recent work has also explored Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in diffusion settings. D3PO [39] and Diffusion-DPO [35] adapt DPO techniques from LLMs to fine-tune diffusion models directly from preference-paired data without a separate reward model. Diffusion-KTO [17] further simplifies supervision by decoupling preference pairs into binary positive/negative sets, though this can introduce semantic biases-e.g., if negative sets are skewed toward specific concepts such as cats, the model may learn undesirable associations.

While RL and DPO-based methods advance preference alignment, they heavily rely on large-scale paired data. SPIN-Diffusion [41] circumvents this by leveraging earlier model checkpoints as negative samples, enabling self-improvement from positive-only data. However, its multi-stage pipeline demands careful hyperparameter tuning to ensure consistent performance.

In contrast, we formulate preference alignment as a max-margin inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, deriving a single-stage objective that encourages the generation of high-quality samples. This formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, thereby reducing semantic bias to some extent. Moreover, it provides a more stable and interpretable training process without requiring iterative self-play or stage-wise tuning.

## 3 Method

## 3.1 Background

We begin with a brief overview of the reinforcement learning framework and the foundational equations for our subsequent derivations. Specifically, for a given image-text pair ( x 0 , c ), there exists an optimal reward model r ( x 0 , c ) that assigns a score representing the level of human preference for the provided image-text pair. Building on prior work [9, 8, 35, 39], the objective of reinforcement learning from human preferences, as defined by the reward model, is formulated as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where C represents the set of prompts, β is the regularization weight, and p θ ref denotes the reference distribution, typically provided by a pre-trained diffusion model. As shown in prior work [11, 15, 25, 26], the optimal density function for Eq. (1) can be derived as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Z ( c ) = ∫ x 0 p θ ref ( x 0 | c ) exp ( 1 β r ( x 0 , c ) ) d x 0 is the partition function. Through algebraic manipulation, the reward function can be reformulated as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Nevertheless, calculating the probability of a clean image in a diffusion model requires marginalizing over the joint distribution p θ ( x 0 | c ) = ∫ x 1: T p θ ( x 0: T | c )d x 1: T . This approach necessitates backpropagation through time [7, 38] to update the model, leading to a substantial increase in memory requirements for training. To mitigate this, we propose a reward model for the entire denoising trajectory, which enables a stepwise gradient calculation to improve computational efficiency.

## 3.2 Trajectory Reward Modeling

Conventional reward models typically predict preference scores solely for the final clean image x 0 , without considering the denoising trajectory. To decompose the full denoising process into individual steps, we follow prior work [35, 42] and assume the existence of a trajectory reward model R ( x 0: T , c ) for a diffusion model p θ ( x 0: T | c ) such that:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where r ( x 0 , c ) aligns with human preferences as defined in Eq. (1). By substituting the reward function in Eq. (4) into Eq. (1) and applying the data processing inequality to expand the KL divergence, we have:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Following the similar derivation as in Eq. (2), the optimal joint density for the lower bound in Eq. (5) is given by:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Z ( c ) = ∫ x 0: T p θ ref ( x 0: T | c ) exp ( 1 β R ( x 0: T , c ) ) d x 0: T is the partition function for the joint density.

## 3.3 Max-Margin Inverse Reinforcement Learning

Human preferences are represented by the labeled data originally used to train reward models. To avoid issues of error accumulation and reward hacking [10], it is advantageous to remove the reward model from preference fine-tuning entirely. This approach aligns with inverse reinforcement

learning (IRL), which aims to learn a policy based on expert demonstrations. We apply a max-margin approach [1, 23] to train a reward model that satisfies the the inductive step condition:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ¯ x 0 and x 0 are samples from the expert demonstration D ( c ) and the policy model p θ ( x 0 | c ) , respectively. Once we establish a reward model ˆ r ( x 0 , c ) based on Eq. (7), a new policy model ˆ p θ is then obtained by maximizing the KL-regularized objective (Eq. (5)) using the reward model ˆ r ( x 0 , c ) . Through altering these two optimization processes, we can obtain the optimal policy model that aligns with the expert demonstrations [1].

However, the reward model aims to maximize the margin between the expert and the policy, while the policy model seeks to minimize this margin to align more closely with the expert. This minimax optimization usually suffers from instability and an exhaustive tuning process. To this end, we further simplify the optimization procedure. First, the inductive criteria Eq. (7) can be rewritten by substituting the reward function from Eq. (4) into it:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

We propose to parameterize the trajectory reward model R by using a formulation similar to Eq. (3):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ϕ represents the learnable parameters of the probability model p ϕ . Assuming that there exist a reward model ˆ R ϕ , parameterized as in Eq. (9) and satisfying the inductive criteria in Eq. (8), we can further obtain the optimal policy by substituting ˆ R ϕ into Eq. (6):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This result implies that the optimal policy model ˆ p θ is identical to reward probability model ˆ p ϕ . Therefore, the alternating optimization reduces to reward modeling alone, where the maximum expected reward is implicitly achieved by Eq. (10) for any given ˆ R ϕ .

To optimize the reward model, we subtract the right hand side from the left hand side of Eq. (8), and substitute the reward parameterization from Eq. (9) into it. Moreover, we use the forward diffusion q (¯ x 1: T | ¯ x 0 ) to approximate sampling expert trajectory ¯ x 0: T from the expert demonstration D ( c ) :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Through algebraic manipulation, this ranking objective is equivalent to (a detailed step-by-step derivation is provided in Appendix D):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ¯ x t ∼ q (¯ x t | ¯ x 0 ) represents samples drawn from forward diffusion with perturbation noise ¯ ϵ ∼ N ( 0 , I ) , and ϵ = ϵ θ ( x t , c , t ) is the noise predicted by the policy diffusion model.

## Connection to Supervised Fine-Tuning

The ranking objective in Eq. (12) can be solved by directly minimizing the negative of the margin:

```

Weeliminate terms that do not depend on ϕ , as they do not contribute to the gradients of reward model. We notice that supervised fine-tuning corresponds to optimizing the first term, which minimizes the KL-divergence between the expert distribution and the distribution induced by the reward model. The second term serves a complementary purpose, where the reward model generates negative samples online to guide the optimization in the correct direction.

## Connection to DPO-based Approaches

Previous DPO-based approaches [35, 39, 30, 40] aim to learn preference predictions using the Bradley-Terry [4] model. Diffusion-DPO applies Jensen's inequality to transform the objective from a probability-based form to a noise-prediction form (Eq.(14) in Wallace et al. 35). This transformation closely resembles solving the ranking problem in Eq. (12) by maximizing the margin using a cross-entropy loss:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where σ ( x ) = 1 / (1 + exp( -x )) denotes the sigmoid function. Unlike prior work, our approach does not require Jensen's inequality to minimize the surrogate upper bound. The max-margin approach enables direct optimization of the margin while ensuring convergence of the policy model. Specifically, we sample pairs from expert demonstration and policy density, whereas DPO-based methods compare preference pairs ( x w , x l ) , where x w is preferred over x l . In other words, the proposed inverse RL approach decouples the need for preference pairs and further eliminates the reliance on negative samples. In practice, public preferences can be obtained through simple statistical methods to rank different samples, with higher-ranked ones treated as expert demonstrations that align with public preferences. The same method can be easily extended to collect expert demonstrations reflecting individual preferences.

## 3.4 Thresholded Ranking Loss

While our proposed reward parameterization reduces the learnable parameters to include only the reward model, two separate models are still maintained to represent the reward and policy, respectively.

To ensure stable reward model updates, the policy model is periodically synchronized with the latest reward model after a predefined number of gradient steps (see line 16 in Alg. 1). However, updating the policy too frequently can limit the reward model's ability to adapt and distinguish expert behaviors from policy outputs. Conversely, infrequent updates may cause the reward model to overfit to the current policy. To balance this trade-off, we introduce a thresholded ranking loss (TRL), which clips the margin loss once the inductive criterion is sufficiently satisfied:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where m is a predefined parameter that adjusts the baseline at which the reward margin is truncated. For samples that already satisfy the inductive criterion, further optimization of the margin is unnecessary. By clipping the margin in these cases, the model can concentrate on rectifying incorrect rankings, thereby avoiding overfitting to samples that are already ranked correctly.

Werefer to the learning process with the objective L TRL ( ϕ ) as Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO). This method learns the ranking relationships between expert demonstrations and policy behaviors. The training process is detailed in Algorithm 1.

## 4 Experiments

We first outline the datasets, implementation details, and evaluation protocols used in our experiments. We then evaluate Diffusion-DRO against multiple baselines using quantitative metrics and supplement our findings with a user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk for qualitative comparison.

Datasets . Following prior works [17, 35, 18], we use the train split of Pick-a-Pic v2 [14] (MIT license) as our training dataset. For evaluation, we adopt the test split of Pick-a-Pic v2 and the HPDv2 benchmark [36] (Apache-2.0 license), representing in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, respectively. Each sample includes a prompt, two images, and a human preference label. Due to label sparsity, we simulate expert demonstrations using automated metrics such as PickScore [14] (MIT license) and HPSv2 [36] (Apache-2.0 license). We rank all training pairs by these scores and select the top K as expert demonstrations; unless otherwise stated, K =500 . Ablation results for varying K are provided in Section 4.4.

Evaluation . We evaluate the human preference alignment by comparing it with various baseline methods. Preference scores are computed using five different score models: PickScore [14], HPSv2 [36], Aesthetic [34] (MIT license), CLIP Score [29] (MIT license) and ImageReward [38] (Apache-2.0 license). For each preference score, we report the win rates between the Diffusion-DRO and the baseline methods, defined as the proportion of generated results with scores exceeding those of the baselines. To ensure fairness, we avoid using the same preference score for selecting the expert demonstrations and calculating the win rates, as this could inadvertently leak score prior information into the train data. Specifically, we use HPSv2 to select the expert demonstrations and calculate win rates for all metrics except for HPSv2. The experiments using different metrics to select expert demonstrations can be found in Appendix B.

Implementation Details . We fine-tune Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD v1-5) [31] (CreativeML Open RAIL-M license) using Diffusion-DRO, ensuring consistency across all baseline methods. To sample x t from the policy model, we employ DPMSolver++ [21] with 20 steps, without using classifier-free guidance [12]. For inference, we use the DDPM sampler with 50 steps and a classifier-free guidance scale of 7.5 to generate five images per prompt for all methods. Among these five generations, we select the image with the median PickScore as the final result. For additional implementation details, please refer to Appendix A.2.

Diffusion-KTO [17]. These methods remove the need for a reward model and are fine-tuned from SD v1-5, consistent with our setup.

Since both expert selection and evaluation rely on automated metrics, there may be concerns about potential information leakage. To address this, we additionally fine-tune SD v1-5 on our selected expert demonstrations and select the best checkpoint based on PickScore performance on the Pick-aPic v2 test set, denoting it as SD v1-5 w/ SFT. Using this model, we further fine-tune Diffusion-DPO, Diffusion-KTO, and Diffusion-SPO with their official implementations 1 . These variants are labeled with the postfix 'w/ SFT.' Table 1 reports the win rates of Diffusion-DRO against all baselines using various automated preference scores. Full results with raw scores and standard deviations are provided in Appendix B.

For the SD v1-5 w/ SFT, performance improves in PickScore, Aesthetic, and ImageReward compared to SD v1-5 (resulting in lower win rates for our method). We attribute this to expert demonstrations enhancing preference alignment. However, an interesting observation is the decline in CLIP Score. This can be attributed to the model slightly deviating from the original text encoder distribution, which was trained on large-scale data. Since Stable Diffusion and CLIP use identical text encoder weights, this deviation leads to a decrease in CLIP Score for SD v1-5 w/ SFT. The same phenomenon is also observed in Diffusion-DPO w/ SFT and Diffusion-KTO w/ SFT since they are fine-tuned from SD v1-5 w/ SFT. For the Diffusion-SPO w/ SFT, their proposed step-aware preference model leverages the CLIP vision and text encoders to select the best and worst samples for fine-tuning. Therefore, the CLIP Score of Diffusion-SPO w/ SFT increases due to the consistent distribution.

We observe that Diffusion-DRO significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches across multiple metrics, including PickScore, Aesthetic, and ImageReward. Even when compared to stronger baselines, such as Diffusion-KTO w/ SFT and Diffusion-DPO w/ SFT, Diffusion-DRO remains the preferred method in terms of all automated evaluation scores. For Diffusion-SPO w/ SFT, its reliance on online sampling for step-aware preference pairs makes it susceptible to the generation quality and diversity of the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. While fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with expert demonstrations enhances preference alignment, it also reduces the variation in step-aware preference pairs. As a result, Diffusion-SPO w/ SFT fails to gain any performance improvement over SD v1-5 w/ SFT. Consequently, Diffusion-DRO significantly outperforms Diffusion-SPO w/ SFT, achieving win rates exceeding 80% across PickScore, Aesthetic, and ImageReward.

Notably, Diffusion-DRO is fine-tuned directly from SD v1-5, unlike strong baseline methods such as Diffusion-DPO w/ SFT and Diffusion-KTO w/ SFT. Despite this, Diffusion-DRO outperforms methods that start fine-tuning from SD v1-5 w/ SFT, demonstrating its capacity to effectively learn human preferences from expert demonstrations.

'

Compared to SPIN-Diffusion, both methods use generations from diffusion models as negative samples. However, Diffusion-DRO simplifies the training process into a single stage by adopting a max-margin inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) formulation. This advantage allows Diffusion-DRO to achieve over a 60% win rate on Aesthetic Score and nearly a 70% win rate on ImageReward, outperforming SPIN-Diffusion.

## 4.2 User Study

The user study compares Diffusion-DRO with baseline methods, including SD v1-5, Diffusion-DPO w/ SFT, and Diffusion-KTO w/ SFT. Text prompts are randomly sampled from the HPDv2 Benchmark to generate images for evaluation. Detailed settings of the user study are provided in Appendix C.

Figure 1 presents the results of our user study, showing that Diffusion-DRO achieves a 75% win rate against SD v1-5. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our training procedure in improving the pre-trained SD model, as human evaluators consistently prefer images generated by Diffusion-DRO. Additionally, the win rates of Diffusion-DRO against Diffusion-DPO (56.67%) and Diffusion-KTO (66.67%) further support the reliability of Table 1. For instance, the average win rate against DiffusionDPO w/ SFT is 59.6%, and against Diffusion-KTO w/ SFT is 63.82%, closely aligning with the user study findings.

## 4.3 Qualitative Results

In Figure 2, we present the generation results of different methods. The example prompts from top to bottom are sampled from the four categories of the HPDv2 Benchmark, namely Anime, Concept Art, Paintings, and Photos. In the first row, Diffusion-DRO successfully generates a 'lemon wearing sunglasses,' while SPIN-Diffusion, Diffusion-KTO, and SD v1-5 fail to produce accurate results. In the second row, both Diffusion-DRO and Diffusion-KTO correctly generate the 'dragon,' the couch,' and the action 'sit,' whereas other methods produce incorrect objects or actions. For the third row, Diffusion-DRO captures the intricate details of Atlantis, while Diffusion-DPO and DiffusionKTO generate abstract content. In the final row, only Diffusion-DRO produces a realistic airplane, whereas the outputs from other methods result in implausible shapes. These examples highlight that Diffusion-DRO significantly improves both text alignment and visual fidelity.

In previous experiments, we observe that SFT delivers competitive performances. Therefore, we are interested in exploring the performance disparity between Diffusion-DRO and SFT under different volumes of training data. To investigate this further, we utilize HPSv2 to select varying quantities of expert demonstrations. These demonstrations are then used to train both Diffusion-DRO and SFT models. The results, depicted in Figure 3, reveal that the CLIP Score consistently increases with the size of the training dataset. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that the text encoder in SD v1-5 is identical to the one used in CLIP, resulting in improved scores as the training data volume increases.

Furthermore, across various test sets, Diffusion-DRO outperforms SFT in terms of PickScore, Aesthetic, and ImageReward metrics. These results demonstrate that the thresholded ranking loss consistently enhances Diffusion-DRO's alignment with human preferences. We attribute this improvement to a fundamental difference in learning objectives. That is, SFT focuses solely on minimizing KL divergence, which neglects the additional expert priors embedded in expert demonstrations. In contrast, Diffusion-DRO leverages these priors by treating policy actions as negative samples, thereby enabling more effective training.

## 5 Conclusion

We propose Diffusion-DRO, a preference learning framework for text-to-image diffusion models based on inverse reinforcement learning. By reformulating the objective to remove the non-linear sigmoid function, our method simplifies optimization into a denoising task, improving training efficiency and stability. Diffusion-DRO further balances offline and online training by combining expert

demonstrations with policy-generated negatives, addressing the limitations of offline data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations and user studies demonstrate that Diffusion-DRO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across diverse and unseen prompts. By integrating human preferences more effectively, our method achieves superior generation quality, making it a robust and scalable solution for preference alignment in text-to-image generation tasks.

## A Experiment Details

## A.1 Datasets

We use the Pick-a-Pic v2 [14] training set as the source of expert demonstrations, consisting of 959,040 preference pairs and 1,029,802 unique text-image pairs. Note that the train set of DiffusionSPO [18] is Pick-a-Pic v1, which is a little different from our settings, but in a comparable range. Our train set is consistent with other baseline methods, i.e., Diffusion-DPO [35] (Apache-2.0 license) and Diffusion-KTO [17]. For testing, we utilize two datasets to ensure diverse evaluation scenarios. The first is the Pick-a-Pic v2 test set, which includes 500 unique text prompts collected from users of the deployed web application. The second is the HPSv2 Benchmark, divided into four categories: anime, concept art, painting, and photo. Each category contains 800 text prompts. However, we observe slight discrepancies in the number of unique prompts: 781 for anime, 795 for concept art, 798 for painting, and 800 for photo. To maintain consistency with prior works [17, 8], we use all 800 prompts (including duplicates) for each category during testing. To select the expert demonstrations from Pick-a-Pic v2, we use a preference metric to give each text-image pair a score representing the quality of being an expert demonstration. We then sort all pairs in descending order by the scores and select the top K pairs as the expert demonstrations. If not otherwise specified, K = 500 is used.

## A.2 Implementation Details

We fine-tune Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD v1-5) [31] using Diffusion-DRO. The AdamW optimizer [20] is used with a learning rate of 10 -4 and an effective batch size of 256 (4 samples per GPU, 32 gradient accumulation steps, yielding 4 × 4 × 16 = 256 ). The training consists of 1,600 optimization steps, resulting in a total of 16 × 1 , 600 = 25 , 600 iterations when accounting for gradient accumulation. During training, 20% of prompts are randomly replaced with empty strings, which helps preserve the model's ability to perform unconditional generation by maintaining a balance between conditional and unconditional sampling.

Following the standard Stable Diffusion training process, we apply an exponential moving average (EMA) to aggregate the UNet weights during training, with a decay rate of 0.9999. The clipping threshold m for the thresholded ranking loss (TRL) is set to -0 . 001 , and the policy model update interval M is set to 1 for all experiments.

For sampling x t from the policy model, we employ DPMSolver++ [21] with 20 steps, without utilizing classifier-free guidance [12]. To ensure all time steps in SD v1-5 are adequately fine-tuned, we uniformly perturb the sampling time steps of DPMSolver++ during training. This approach allows the time steps used during inference to differ from those used for online sampling in training, enhancing the model's robustness across all time steps.

All experiments, including the reproduction of baseline methods with updated SD model weights, were conducted on four NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. Training Diffusion-DRO takes approximately 20 to 25 hours.

The dagger symbol ( † ) indicates that the evaluation was performed on the officially released model weights. Note that SD v1-5 w/ SFT refers to SD v1-5 fine-tuned on expert demonstrations. Win rates greater than 50% are highlighted in bold.

## B Additional Quantitative Results

To alleviate the variation of evaluation results, we sample 5 images per prompt for all models in our benchmark. Specifically, we sample 2500 images for Pick-a-Pic v2 test and 16000 images for HPDv2 Benchmark. When calculating the win rates, we sort 5 images for each prompt according to the corresponding PickScore and select the image with medium score as the comparison target.

We report the win rates of Diffusion-DRO trained with HPSv2 selected expert demonstrations in Table 1. For the Diffusion-DRO trained with PickScore selected expert demonstrations. The win rates against baseline methods are show in Table 2. Due to the limited computation resources, we do not reproduce the baseline methods based on the new SD model (SD v1-5 w/SFT in Table 2). We only compare the Diffusion-DRO with the officially released model weights.

We present the average preference scores in Table 3 and Table 4, including PickScore [14], HPSv2 [36], Aesthetic [34], CLIP Score [29], and ImageReward [38].

## C User Study Settings

As shown in Table 1, the automated win rates of our method are decreased after Diffusion-DPO and Diffusion-KTO using the new SD model as base weights, e.g., the win rate compared to Diffusion-

DPO and Diffusion-DPO w/ SFT on HPDv2 Benchmark decreases from 79.75 to 63.62 evaluated by PickScore. This shows that Diffusion-DPO w/ SFT and Diffusion-KTO w/ SFT are more competitive than the official released models. Therefore, we choose these two baseline models plus an SD v1-5 to be baseline methods in user studies. We use the same images generated for calculating metrics in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 1. We prepare the prompts by random sampling 60 prompts from four categoryies of HPDv2 Benchmark (15 prompts for each category). For each category, we use PickScore to sort the samples for each method and select the image with medium score as the survey target. To avoid survey participants identifying our generation results, we re-sample the prompts for each user study between Diffusion-DRO and baseline methods. This could prevent our samples from repeated occurences in different user studies.

We employ human evaluators via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for our user studies. Although the HPDv2 Benchmark includes additional filtering steps to remove inappropriate prompts, we still indicate that the user survey may contain adult content. Before beginning the survey, users must check the box labeled 'WARNING: This HIT may contain adult content. Worker discretion is advised.'

On the survey page, participants can access the evaluation guidelines, which include the following instructions:

For each text prompt, two AI-generated images will be displayed side by side. You can evaluate which image better meets human expectations based on (but not limited to) the following criteria. The importance of each criterion depends on your subjective judgment:

- Completeness of details
- Artistic or aesthetic quality
- Alignment between the image and the given prompt

In short, select the image that you believe demonstrates better generation quality.

On each selection page, the prompt is displayed along with two images labeled Image A and Image B , accompanied by the question: 'Which image do you prefer given the prompt?' Below the question, two radio buttons allow users to select either Image A or Image B, with at least one selection required before submission. To ensure fairness, the images generated by Diffusion-DRO and the baseline methods are randomly assigned to Image A and Image B. Additionally, their sources cannot be identified through the webpage's source code.

For each prompt, we collect 35 responses. If the majority of these responses favor Diffusion-DRO, the prompt is considered to prefer Diffusion-DRO. Finally, we compute the proportion of prompts that favor our method as the win rate, which is reported in Figure 1.

## D Derivation of Denoising Ranking Optimization

For convenience, we repeat Eq. (11) below:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The first term on the left-hand side (LHS) and second term on the right-hand side (RHS) share similar simplification processes. We first present the derivation of the LHS:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

All diffusion hyperparameter notations, i.e., σ t , α t , ¯ α t , and β t , follow the definitions from DDPM [13]. Here, β represents the KL regularization weight as defined in Eq. (1) and C is a constant independent of ϕ . We then derive the RHS:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Substituting Eqs. (23) and (30) into Eq. (16), we obtain:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Following the DDPM settings, we set λ t = 1 to obtain our final result.

## E Ethics

The Pick-a-Pic v2 dataset has been identified as containing NSFW prompts, as it is collected from publicly available user inputs on the internet. To minimize exposure to violent, adult, or otherwise inappropriate content, we chose HPDv2 as the prompt source for user studies. Participants are also informed of this facts before they start the study.

For a fair comparison with previous methods, we continue to use Pick-a-Pic v2 as part of the training data. Given the strong performance of Diffusion-DRO, there is a potential risk that the model could generate NSFW content. However, Diffusion-DRO does not explicitly learn to produce NSFW images; its outputs are inherently dependent on the training dataset.

To mitigate this risk in future applications, NSFW content can be filtered at the data level by curating human preference datasets that exclude inappropriate content, thereby preventing Diffusion-DRO from learning to generate such images. Before publicly releasing our model, we will ensure the implementation of an additional safety filter to prevent misuse.

## F Limitations

Despite the significant improvements Diffusion-DRO brings to aligning diffusion models with human preferences, it remains constrained by the data-dependent nature of diffusion models. Specifically, the approach relies on expert demonstrations extracted from data, which may introduce distributional biases-for example, simpler prompts tend to yield better outputs and are thus more likely to be selected as expert data. Diffusion-DRO does not explicitly account for such biases and disregards non-expert demonstrations, which may result in a model that performs well only in limited domains.

## G Future Work

While Diffusion-DRO introduces the concept of expert demonstrations from an inverse reinforcement learning perspective, future work could extend this framework beyond the current max-margin formulation by incorporating non-expert data to enhance performance in underrepresented or sparse regions of the data distribution. Furthermore, our current approach treats preferences as binary rankings (i.e., preferred vs. not preferred), which results in the loss of list-wise ranking information [19]. We believe that integrating such richer preference structures into the inverse reinforcement learning framework could further refine the granularity and stability of the optimization process.

## H Additional Samples

In this section, we provide additional sample comparisons with baseline methods, including DiffusionDPO w/ SFT, Diffusion KTO w/ SFT, Diffusion-SPO, and SD v1-5.

## NeurIPS Paper Checklist

## 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The main claims in the abstract and introduction are supported by theoretical derivations in Section 3 and by empirical results, including quantitative evaluations and user studies, in Section 4.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

## 2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the limitations of Diffusion-DRO in Appendix F, including its scope of applicability and potential weaknesses in specific scenarios.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

## 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide a step-by-step derivation of our theoretical results in Appendix D.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

## 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the main experimental settings in Section 4, detailed configurations in Appendix A, and include the source code in the supplementary material to ensure reproducibility of the main results.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

## 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We include the source code for training and evaluation in the supplementary material, along with instructions to reproduce the main experimental results.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so 'No' is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
- The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

## 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The main experimental settings are provided in Section 4, with full details-including data splits, hyperparameters, and optimizer configurations-available in Appendix A.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

## 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report the standard deviation of scores for all evaluated models in Appendix B.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

- The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
- The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
- It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

## 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report the training time of our methods and the computing resources used in Appendix A.2.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

## 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We follow the NeurIPS Code of ethics in conducting our user study, with relevant details provided in Appendix C.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

## 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: A discussion of societal impacts is included in Appendix E as part of our ethics review.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
- Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
- The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

## 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: As described in Appendix E, we will include a safety checker with the released model to help mitigate potential misuse.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

## 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We include the licenses for all publicly available assets used in our work in Section 4, along with proper attribution to their original creators.

Guidelines:

- The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
- The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
- The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

- For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
- If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
- For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
- If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The released source code is accompanied by documentation that describes its usage and functionality.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

## 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Appendix C provides the full text of participant instructions.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We did not obtain IRB approval. However, we clearly disclosed the potential risks associated with participating in the user study, as detailed in Appendix C.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

- Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
- We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
- For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

## 16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We did not use any LLMs as part of the core methodology in this research.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.
- Please refer to our LLM policy ( https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM ) for what should or should not be described.
