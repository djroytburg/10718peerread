## Abstract

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely utilized to incorporate external knowledge into large language models, thereby enhancing factuality and reducing hallucinations in question-answering (QA) tasks. A standard RAG pipeline consists of several components, such as query rewriting, document retrieval, document filtering, and answer generation. However, these components are typically optimized separately through supervised fine-tuning, which can lead to misalignments between the objectives of individual components and the overarching aim of generating accurate answers. Although recent efforts have explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize specific RAG components, these approaches often focus on simple pipelines with only two components or do not adequately address the complex interdependencies and collaborative interactions among the modules. To overcome these limitations, we propose treating the complex RAG pipeline with multiple components as a multi-agent cooperative task, in which each component can be regarded as an RL agent. Specifically, we present MMOA-RAG 2 , M ultiM odule joint O ptimization A lgorithm for RAG , which employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to harmonize all agents' goals toward a unified reward, such as the F1 score of the final answer. Experiments conducted on various QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMOA-RAG effectively boost the overall performance of the pipeline and outperforms existing baselines. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of individual components and demonstrate MMOA-RAG can be adapted to different RAG pipelines and benchmarks.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied to tasks such as question answering [1, 23], information retrieval [45, 2], various forms of reasoning [15, 13], and evaluation [11, 8]. However, since LLMs cannot promptly update their internal knowledge after pre-training, they are still prone to generating outdated or fabricated responses [58]. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the generative capabilities of LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources. Recent RAG systems are often built as complex pipelines comprising multiple interconnected modules [10], including query rewriting [30, 19], first-stage retrieval [25, 40], re-ranking [36, 37], document preprocessing [22, 27], and answer generation [40, 44].

The complexity of RAG systems makes their optimization particularly challenging. Standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) optimizes each module independently using human-annotated data. However,

this often results in misalignment between the objectives of individual components and the overarching goal of the system of generating high-quality results. For example, retrieval modules are frequently trained on human-labeled relevance data to optimize metrics such as nDCG[18]. However, this process does not address the disconnect between document relevance and response quality documents with high relevance scores do not always contribute to generating accurate answers [6].

To address this issue, existing work on end-to-end optimization for RAG, such as [24, 12, 25, 37] aims to propagate rewards from the final output to intermediate modules using techniques such as attention distributions [17], generation probability [25, 56], and expectation maximization (EM) iterations [42, 36]. However, earlier approaches primarily focus on simplified pipelines with only two components-a retriever and a generator-and fail to provide a generalizable framework for jointly optimizing complex systems with multiple components and richer interdependencies. More recent methods attempt to eliminate the need for module-specific rewards by leveraging algorithms like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [33] and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)[39]. Nonetheless, these methods still concentrate on optimizing individual RAG modules in isolation, without adequately modeling the collaborative dynamics between interacting components [27, 30, 22]. Effectively capturing interdependencies among multiple modules and jointly optimizing complex RAG architectures remains an open research challenge.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the M ultiM odule joint O ptimization A lgorithm (MMOA-RAG)toenable joint optimization across multiple modules in a RAG system. Our framework treats each intermediate component in the RAG pipeline as an agent and formulates the optimization process as a Co operative M ultiA gent R einforcement L earning (Co-MARL) problem, where the agents (i.e., modules) work together to maximize a shared reward for the final outcome.

Specifically, we focus on applying MMOA-RAG to a RAG pipeline that includes four key modules: a query rewriter, a fixed document retriever, a document selector, and an answer generator. Our primary objective is to optimize these modules by defining the final reward as the correctness of the generated response, measured by the F1 score against the ground-truth answer. To achieve this, we leverage the Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) algorithm [55], which facilitates collaborative optimization in a fully cooperative setting. This means that all modules work in a cooperative way, with their optimization goals aligned toward producing high-quality answers. Unlike previous methods that rely on DPO [62, 61] or PPO [30, 22], MMOA-RAG offers greater flexibility for different pipeline designs and excels at promoting collaboration among multiple modules. This end-to-end optimization ensures that each module's objectives are consistently aligned with the overarching goal of generating accurate responses.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MMOA-RAG modeling and optimization approach, we conducted experiments on three publicly available QA datasets, HotpotQA [53], 2WikiMultihopQA [14] and AmbigQA [31], based on Llama-3-8B-Instruct [7]. The experimental results indicate that MMOA-RAG achieves better performance than a series of existing optimization methods for RAG. Additionally, we performed extensive ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness and advantages of jointly optimizing mulitple modules in the RAG system and the generalizability of MMOA-RAG across different RAG pipelines.

Our main contributions are as follows:

- We innovatively model RAG as a multi-agent collaborative task, treating multiple modules within the RAG pipeline as individual agents.
- We employ a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to jointly optimize a sophisticated RAG system with four key modules: a query writer, a fixed document retriever, a document selector, and an answer generator.
- We conduct extensive experiments to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework.

PPO [39] is used by some works [39, 30, 22, 9, 19] to fine-tune LLMs. Specifically, Search-r1 [21] and R1-Searcher [43] both use answer-based reward to improve the reasoning in RAG. Additionally, DPO [33] or similar alignment algorithms are used to optimize LLMs in RAG task [33, 62, 61, 59, 27]. More detailed related works can be seen in Appendix A.

## 3 Method

## 3.1 Modeling RAG as Co-MARL

In this work, we conceptualize the RAG procedure within a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (Co-MARL) framework. Within this framework, each module of the RAG pipeline functions as an individual RL agent. The overarching objective of this multi-agent system is to produce high-quality answers, which aligns with the individual goals of each module.

We define the tuple ⟨G , O , A , R⟩ , where G denotes the set of agents in the Co-MARL system, O represents the observation information available to each agent, A constitutes the action space accessible to each agent, and R is the reward shared among all agents. The ultimate aim is to maximize this shared reward, thereby achieving higher evaluation metrics and enhancing the overall performance of the RAG system.

In this paper we utilizes Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) [55], which is an extension of the PPO algorithm [39] for multi-agent environments, to optimize the policy for each agent in the Co-MARL framework. In fully cooperative settings, unlike PPO, which focuses on single-agent scenarios with individual reward, MAPPO employs a shared global reward to promote cooperation among all agents.

## 3.2 Overall of MMOA-RAG

RAG systems typically follow a modular architecture composed of multiple interconnected components. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of our MMOA-RAG framework, which consists of four primary modules: the Query Rewriter, the Retriever, the Selector, and the Generator:

- Query Rewriter reformulates the initial question q , which may be too complex or ambiguous to resolve with a single retrieval, into a set of sub-questions denoted as subq .
- Retriever retrieves relevant documents from the corpus for each sub-questions, respectively, and outputs a set of candidate document D .

- Selector further filters D to obtain a subset of documents D selected that is useful for generating the final answer to the initial query q .
- Generator leverages D selected to generate the predicted answer Ans predict to the initial question.

Since the Query Rewriter, Selector, and Generator modules can all be implemented using LLMs, they can be treated as RL agents [32], enabling parameter updates through reward signals. To optimize computational efficiency, these three modules can share the same LLM. Additionally, given the difficulty of modeling the Retriever module as an RL agent, we use a fixed Retriever and regard it as a part of the environment 3 .

The focus of the MMOA-RAG framework is on the collaborative optimization of multiple modules to align their individual objectives with the ultimate goal of generating high-quality answers. We use metrics from the Generator's predicted answer Ans predict, such as F1 score, as a shared reward R shared . Given the fully cooperative nature of the modules in the RAG system, R shared can be used to train all agents, a common approach in existing MARL literature [35, 55, 4]. Additionally, to ensure training stability and accelerate convergence in the multi-agent system, we design penalty terms P QR , P S , and P G for each agent. A more detailed explanation will be provided in Section 3.3.

## 3.3 Detailed Configuration for Each Agent

In this section, we will provide a detailed explanation of each element in the tuple ⟨G , O , A , R⟩ mentioned in Section 3.1. Here, G = { Query Rewriter (QR), Selector (S), Generator (G) } represents all agents. In the following, we introduce the essential elements for each agent i ∈ G : the observation information O i ∈ O , the action space A i ∈ A , and the reward function R i .

## 3.3.1 Elements of Query Rewriter

Observation of Query Rewriter is defined as Equation (1), which contains prompt of Query Rewriter Prompt QR (as shown in Table 3) and the initial question q .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Action Space of Query Rewriter corresponds to the vocabulary of LLMs, denoted as V , as we prompt the LLM to generate one or more sub-questions based on q .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Reward Function of the Query Rewriter is defined as shown in Equation (3). Here, R shared can be the metric for the final answer, depicted as the yellow section in Figure 1. In this paper, we utilize the F1 score of the predicted answer, Ans predict, as the shared reward. The term P QR serves as a penalty to discourage the Query Rewriter from generating an excessive number of sub-questions during training. Specifically, P QR is assigned a value of -0.5 if the number of sub-questions exceeds four, and it is set to 0 if the number of sub-questions is four or fewer.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## 3.3.2 Elements of Selector

Observation of Selector is defined as Equation (4), which contains prompt of Selector Prompt S (as shown in Table 4), the initial question q and the candidate documents set D with K documents.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Action Space of Selector only comprises of several words as Equation (5). Since the function of the Selector is to output the IDs of candidate documents helpful to answering the initial question q , the action space is constrained to this limited set of words. This constraint can significantly reduce the exploration space of the Selector and provide a more stable training process.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

3 Recent studies in generative IR (see [26] for a survey) have explored using generative models for retrieval. But we choose a more traditional dense retrieval model [16] as the first-stage retriever and leave the optimization of the first-stage retriever for future work.

Reward Function of Selector also contains two terms, which are R shared and P S . And P S is a penalty term designed to prevent the Selector from generating duplicate document IDs and from outputting IDs that do not conform to the specified format (e.g., Document0,Document3,Document9). When the Selector outputs duplicate document IDs or fails to adhere to the specified format, P S is set to -1; otherwise, P S is set to 0.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## 3.3.3 Elements of Generator

Observation of Generator is in Equation (7), containing prompt of Generator Prompt G (as shown in Table 5), the initial question q and the selected candidate documents set D selected given by Selector.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Action Space of Generator A G is the same as Query Rewriter.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Reward Function of Generator contains R shared and penalty term P G , which is used to constrain the model from generating excessively long content. When the generated answer exceeds a certain length, P G is set to -0.5; otherwise, it is set to 0. In fact, the values of each penalty P i ( i ∈ G ) are mostly 0, and they only become negative when the output does not meet the requirements.

## 3.4 Training Process of MMOA-RAG

## 3.4.1 Warm Start with SFT

In preparation for joint optimization of multiple modules using Multi-Agent PPO, it is essential to perform a warm start for each trainable module. The warm start enables the model to better adhere to instructions across diverse tasks and reduces the exploration space during MARL joint training, thereby enhancing the efficiency of exploration and exploitation.

Within the MMOA-RAG framework, there are three trainable modules: the Query Rewriter, the Selector, and the Generator. Consequently, we construct the training data for the SFT of each corresponding task and perform the SFT to get the warm-up checkpoints for each trainable modules. The details of constructing training data can be seen in Appendix B.

## 3.4.2 Multi-Agent Optimization

After undergoing SFT, the LLM demonstrates an improved ability to follow instructions while executing the functions of Query Rewriter, Selector, and Generator. The RAG system also achieves relatively satisfactory warm-start performance. To further enhance the performance of the RAG system, which is modeled as a fully cooperative multi-agent system, it is crucial to conduct joint training of multiple agents to strengthen collaboration among them.

We adopt a setup similar to Multi-Agent PPO [55] in Starcraft II, where multiple agents share a global reward, optimizing G = { QR, S, G } with R shared. To reduce computational overhead, we apply the parameter-sharing mechanism among agents, allowing QR, S, and G to utilize the same LLM.

In the multi-agent optimization process, there are three models to consider: the Actor model, the Critic model, and the SFT model. The parameters for these models are denoted as θ , ϕ , and θ SFT, respectively. The role of the Actor model is to provide the response Answer i based on the observation O i for each agent i . The Critic model is responsible for estimating the state-value function V i,t ϕ , which is a classic setup in Actor-Critic architecture within RL algorithms. The SFT model serves as a baseline for the Actor model, similar to InstructGPT [32]. The objective is to update the parameters of both the Actor and Critic models. The overall loss function, L ( θ, ϕ ) , consists of two terms: L Actor ( θ ) and L Critic ( ϕ ) :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The Actor loss function presented in Equation (11) is similar to that used in the typical single-agent PPO [39] algorithm. The primary difference is that multiple agents are being optimized. In Equation

(11), i ∈ G denotes the three agents: Query Rewriter, Selector, and Generator. The term r i t in Equation (12) denotes the importance sampling ratio, which measures the difference between the new and old policies. The expression ˆ A i,t π θ in Equation (13) is the advantage function, estimated using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) [38]. The variable δ i t in Equation (14) is known as the temporal difference (TD) error at time step t .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Similar to InstructGPT [32], the final reward function R ( s i t , a i t ) is defined in Equation (15). The distinction is that our approach does not require a trained reward model, as we use the evaluation metric (F1 score) of the predicted answers Ans predict of Generator as the shared reward R shared for all agents. The penalty term P i can also be easily obtained from the output of each agent, as introduced in Section 3.3. The components R i in Equation (15) are defined in Equations (3), (6), or (9). And Answer i represents the output generated by each agent i based on its individual observation O i .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The loss function of the Critic model, as shown in Equation (16), employs a clipping operation similar to the Actor model. Here, ∆ V i,t = V i,t ϕ -V i,t target , where V i,t ϕ = V ϕ ( s i t ) . The term V i,t target represents the cumulative return and s i t is the state-value function.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The pseudocode for multi-agent optimization based on MAPPO is shown in Algorithm 1 in Appendix C, which corresponds to the overall framework of MMOA-RAG depicted in Figure 1. For a specific question, the first step is to execute the Collect Rollout process. This process involves passing through the Query Rewriter, Retriever, Selector, and Generator, and the computed tuple T = (( O QR , subq, R QR ) , ( O S , IDs, R S ) , ( O G , Ans predict , R G )) is stored in the replay buffer M . Next, the Policy and Value Optimization process is executed where the GAE is used to estimate the advantage function ˆ A i,t π θ . Subsequently, the overall loss function L ( θ, ϕ ) is calculated, and the parameters of both the Actor and Critic models are updated. Additionally, to accelerate the entire training process, we can run a minibatch in parallel. Ultimately, we obtain a well-trained Actor model used for subsequent inference and evaluation.

## 4 Experiments

Our experiments mainly aim to explore the following research questions:

RQ1: How does our MMOA-RAG perform compared to existing RAG optimization methods?

RQ2: How does the joint optimization of individual modules in the RAG pipeline contribute to the effectiveness of MMOA-RAG framework?

RQ3: Can MMOA-RAG exhibit generalizability across different RAG systems?

## 4.1 Experimental Settings

Datasets and Evaluation We conducted experiments using MMOA-RAG alongside various baseline models across three open-domain QA datasets: HotpotQA [53], 2WikiMultihopQA [14], and AmbigQA [31]. The candidate documents are all retrieved from Wikipedia passages for three datasets.

We employ three key evaluation metrics-Accuracy, Exact Match (EM), and F1 score-to assess the performance of the RAG methods.

Implementation Details We utilize Contriever [16] as the Retriever for most experiments. And the Selector consistently receives a fixed set of K = 10 documents as input. Besides, we employ Llama-3-8B-Instruct [7] as the foundational LLM for all the baselines and MMOA-RAG.

We compare MMOA-RAG with different baseline methods: LLM w/o RAG , Vanilla RAG w/o train , Vanilla RAG w SFT , SELF-RAG [1], RetRobust [54], Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [30], BGM [22], RAG-DDR [27].

The detailed introduction of experimental settings and baselines can be seen in Appendix D.

## 4.2 Comparisons with Other Methods

We conducted a comparative analysis of MMOA-RAG against multiple baselines, with the results presented in Table 1. To ensure fairness in comparison, all methods utilized Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the backbone LLM, and all baselines were re-implemented according to the settings delineated in Appendix D.2.

Firstly, as shown in Table 1, MMOA-RAG demonstrates superior performance across all metrics and datasets, highlighting its effectiveness. Additionally, it is noteworthy that Vanilla RAG w/o train achieves comparable results to LLM w/o RAG across various metrics. This observation suggests that the pre-trained Llama-3-8B-Instruct struggles to effectively leverage external knowledge for answer generation, likely due to the absence of RAG-related tasks in its pre-training process, which limits its external knowledge utilization. In contrast, Vanilla RAG w SFT exhibits substantial improvements over Vanilla RAG w/o train across all evaluation metrics. This indicates that the SFT-enhanced Llama3-8B-Instruct is adept at utilizing external knowledge, successfully extracting valuable information from noisy candidate documents to enhance the quality of generated answers.

The Rewrite-Retrieve-Read and BGM approaches enhance Vanilla RAG by respectively integrating a query rewrite module and a bridge module, each of which is trained using the PPO algorithm. As indicated in Table 1, on the multi-hop datasets HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA, Rewrite-RetrieveRead surpasses BGM, suggesting that the inclusion of a query rewrite module is more effective than adding a bridge module for these multi-hop datasets. Conversely, on the single-hop dataset AmbigQA, the performance of Rewrite-Retrieve-Read and BGM is relatively similar. Our MMOA-RAG can be conceptualized as augmenting Vanilla RAG by integrating both a Query Rewriter and a Selector, whose roles are akin to the query rewrite module in Rewrite-Retrieve-Read and the bridge module in BGM. The primary advantage of MMOA-RAG lies in its simultaneous optimization of the Query Rewriter, Selector, and Generator modules. This is achieved by aligning the objectives of these modules with the goal of generating higher-quality answers via MAPPO. The experimental results presented in Table 1 further illustrate that MMOA-RAG significantly outperforms Rewrite-RetrieveRead, BGM, and other baselines.

In addition, we tested various methods based on other retriever, BGE [49] and E5 [47], and the results can be seen in Table 7 in Appendix E. And we also perform out-of-domain experiments, the results can be seen in Table 8 in Appendix F. In summary, The results in Table 1, Table 7, Table 8, and the

analysis in this Section 4.2 jointly answer the RQ1 . And the case study can be found in Appendix I, from which we can intuitively understand the advantages of multi-module joint optimization.

## 4.3 Ablation Experiments on the Optimization of Different Agents

To demonstrate the necessity of multi-agent joint optimization in RAG systems, we present ablation experiments in this section. The MMOA-RAG framework, depicted in Figure 1, consists of three agents: i ∈ { Query Rewriter (QR), Selector (S), Generator (G) } . In Figure 2, MMOA-RAG w/o i denotes the variant where agent i is excluded from the complete optimization process of multi-agent joint optimization.

As illustrated in Figure 2, the complete version of MMOA-RAG, where all three modules are jointly optimized, delivers the highest performance. This underscores the effectiveness of multi-agent joint optimization within the RAG system and validates the importance of optimizing multiple modules concurrently. Additionally, the MMOA-RAG w/o S variant achieves the best performance among the three ablation configurations. The Selector's primary function is to refine the candidate document set D , yielding a higher-quality subset D selected , which enhances the Generator's ability to produce a superior answer Ans predict. However, through the joint optimization by MAPPO, the Generator acquires some denoising capabilities. Consequently, satisfactory results can be achieved even when the Selector is not optimized during joint optimization.

We also present the trajectory of the shared reward R shared during the training process based on abla- tion experiments conducted on the AmbigQA dataset, as shown in Figure 3. From Figure 3, it is evident that the reward curve for MMOA-RAG demonstrates the fastest convergence rate and achieves the highest final convergence value. This underscores the effectiveness of joint optimization across multiple modules in significantly and efficiently enhancing the performance of the RAG system. Furthermore, the training curve for MMOA-RAG w/o G in Figure 3 is noticeably slower compared to other algorithms, and the test results for MMOA-RAG w/o G on the AmbigQA dataset, as shown in Figure 2, are the poorest. These findings suggest that the Generator module is the most critical component for the single-hop AmbigQA dataset.

The results in Figure 2 and Figure 3 answer the RQ.2 that it is more effective to optimize multiple modules in a RAG system simultaneously.

## 4.4 Generality Experiments on RAG Systems with Varying Module Configurations

In this section, we evaluate the performance of MMOA-RAG in optimizing RAG systems with different numbers of agents, as detailed in Table 2. In Table 2, QR+S+G represents the RAG

framework depicted in Figure 1, illustrating a multi-agent system composed of three agent, Query Rewriter, Selector and Generator. The configuration S+G results from omitting the Query Rewriter agent, relying solely on the initial question q for retrieval, thereby configuring the RAG system as a two-agent (Selector and Generator) system. Conversely, QR+G denotes the exclusion of the Selector agent, forming a RAG pipeline consisting of two agents, Query Rewriter and Generator. The second column of Table 2 specifies that SFT refers to the warm start of all agents in the corresponding RAG system through supervised fine-tuning, while MAPPO refers to the joint optimization of all agents built upon SFT utilizing the MAPPO framework. The notation ∆ is used to denote the performance enhancement achieved by MAPPO compared to SFT.

The experimental results in Table 2 reveal that RAG systems optimized using joint MAPPO consistently outperform those using only SFT across all datasets. This finding underscores the robust generalizability of the MMOA-RAG joint optimization approach, yielding significant performance improvements across diverse RAG configurations. Notably, the performance gains from MAPPO over SFT are approximately three percentage points on multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA, while improvements on the single-hop dataset AmbigQA are around two percentage points. This difference may stem from the greater complexity inherent to multi-hop datasets, which potentially exacerbates misalignment among different modules during the SFT stage. These results further highlight the necessity of multi-module joint optimization, especially in the context of more challenging multi-hop datasets.

The results presented in Table 2 demonstrate the effectiveness of MMOA-RAG in optimizing various RAG systems across different configurations, thereby answering RQ.3 .

## 5 Conclusions and Future Works

In this paper, we model the RAG system as a multi-agent collaborative task, wherein we consider the Query Rewriter, Selector, and Generator modules as learnable RL agents. We employ a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to jointly optimize these agents, aligning the optimization goals of multiple modules with the ultimate objective of generating high-quality answers.

Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our modeling approach and joint optimization method. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity and generality of multi-module joint optimization, establishing MMOA-RAG as an effective approach for optimizing RAG systems.

In future works, we intend to explore the application of MMOA-RAG in more complex workflows. This exploration will include scenarios where the RAG workflows are organized as a directed acyclic graph, as well as situations involving dynamic workflows within agentic RAG. Additionally, it is important to assess the cost and latency associated with specific modules within the RAG system. In this regard, the design of the reward function should not be exclusively based on evaluation metrics, such as the F1 score highlighted in this paper. Instead, it should aim to strike a balance between effectiveness and cost in those partially cooperative RAG scenarios.

## NeurIPS Paper Checklist

## 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We claimed the main contribution and the scope in our abstract and introduction. Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

## 2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss some limitations of our proposed method in Appendix G.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

## 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

## 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide all the details and the anonymous code url in the paper.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

## 5. Open access to data and code

- The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

## 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We don't do the statistical significance tests.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
- The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
- The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
- It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.

- It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

## 8. Experiments compute resources

- The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate

deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.

- The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

For example, DSP [23] leverages sophisticated interactions between retrieval and language models to address knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. FLARE [20], an active retrieval augmented generation method, enhances text generation by dynamically retrieving relevant information throughout the process, showing superior performance across various long-form knowledge-intensive tasks.

## A.3.2 Optimizing RAG with RL

Some existing works use PPO [39] algorithm to fine-tune LLMs. In Rewrite-Retrieve-Read framework [30], a small language model is trained with reinforcement learning to rewrite queries for RAG. BGM [22] proposes a novel bridge mechanism between retrieval model and LLMs and uses PPO to optimize the parameters of the bridge to filter for more helpful documents. SMARTRAG [9] optimizes an iterative RAG framework with reward, which includes a decision maker and a policy network. RAG-Star [19] is a reasoning approach that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve the complex reasoning abilities of LLMs. Additionally, concurrent work Search-r1 [21] and R1-Searcher [43] both use answer-based reward to improve the reasoning in RAG.

ATM [61], an Adversarial Tuning Multi-agent system, enhances the robustness and performance of retrieval-augmented generators in question answering by iteratively tuning against an adversarial attacker agent to better discriminate useful documents and resist fabricated content. SEER [59] proposes a novel self-aligned evidence extraction learning framework aimed at enhancing RAG performance by optimizing the extraction of high-quality, concise, and relevant evidence. RAG-DDR [27] optimizes RAG systems by aligning data preferences between modules through DDR, resulting in enhanced performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.

## B How to Construct Training Data for the SFT Training Process

Before the multi-module joint training process of MAPPO, the warm-up to each trainable modules is necessary. The warm-up can make LLMs to follow the instructions better and reduce the exploration space for the MAPPO training process to stabilize and accelerate the joint training process.

In this section, we introduce the details of constructing training data for each modules.

## B.1 Query Rewriter

Query Rewriter is to reformulate the initial query q , which may be too complex or ambiguous to resolve with a single retrieval, into a set of sub-questions denoted as subq . The prompt of Query Rewriter is in Table 3.

In Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [30], a small language model was trained using PPO to effectively rewrite queries for RAG. Building on this approach, we utilize the publicly available query rewriting data from Rewrite-Retrieve-Read as the SFT dataset to warm start the Query Rewriter in MMOA-RAG.

Table 3: The prompt of Query Rewriter agent.

system: You are a professional assistant skilled at rewriting complex or unclear questions into simpler, more searchable subquestions.

assistant: Okay, I will provide the rewritten sub-questions.

user: Please help me rewrite or decompose the given questions into sub-questions, making them easier to search for answers in a search engine. The rewritten sub-questions must have logical connections and dependencies, without being overly repetitive in meaning. Additionally, avoid using vague demonstrative pronouns and similar terms.

assistant: Okay, I will provide the rewritten sub-questions.

user: Original question is {content of Question}. Now rewrite or decompose the original question into sub-questions according to the above requirements, and only output the rewritten subquestions in the format of one subproblem per line without any additional content. Additionally, avoid using vague demonstrative pronouns and similar terms, avoid the duplicate subquestions.

## B.2 Selector

The task of the Selector is to choose a subset D selected that are helpful for answering a question from a given set D with K candidate documents.

The output format of the Selector is the IDs of the documents in D selected (e.g., Document0, Document4, Document6, Document7), as shown in the prompt of Selector in Table 4. Therefore, to construct SFT data for the Selector, the ground truth should be the IDs of documents that are truly useful for answering the question. One method to obtain the ground truth is to employ advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4o, to provide the ground truth. However, we have found that this approach does not yield results as good as expected. Additionally, BGM [22] introduced and optimized a bridge module which is similar to the Selector module. They proposed a method called synthesis silver passage sequence (Synthesis SPS) to construct the ground truth for SFT data. However, the Synthesis SPS method requires examining each candidate document d i,j ∈ D i (candidate documents of question i ), invoking the LLM for each check, and comparing the utility values before and after the check, making it a complex and costly method.

Table 4: The prompt of Selector agent.

<!-- image -->

We propose a convenient heuristic approach for constructing SFT data, aimed at LLMs to effectively follow instructions and output in the desired format. As illustrated in Figure 4, for a given question q i and its golden answer, there are K candidate documents denoted as d i,j , where j ∈ { 0 , 1 , · · · , K -1 } . First, by removing certain insignificant stop words and punctuation marks from q i and its golden answer, and converting the words to lowercase, we obtain the set Set q i . Similarly, we perform the same operation on the K candidate documents d i,j to obtain Set d i,j . Finally, if any word from Set q i appears in Set d i,j , the ID of corresponding document j is included in the final output as the Label of SFT. With this approach, we can rapidly and cost-effectively construct the Selector's ground truth labels during the SFT stage. Given our focus on the subsequent joint optimization of multiple modules, this straightforward data construction method can adequately meet our requirements.

## B.3 Generator

The Generator is responsible for producing the final answer, Ans predict, based on the D selected provided by the Selector. Therefore, the ground truth for the SFT data of Generator is the golden answer Ans golden. And the prompt of Generator is in Table 5.

Figure 4: The convenient approach to construct the SFT data for Selector.

<!-- image -->

Table 5: The prompt of Generator agent.

system: You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Your task is to predict the answer to the question based on the given documents. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information. Answer the question as accurately as possible.

assistant: Okay, I will provide the answer to the question based on the corresponding documents. Please provide the question and the corresponding documents.

```
user: Question: {content of Question} Document0: {content of Document0} Document3: {content of Document3} . . . Document7: {content of Document7}
```

assistant: OK, I received the Question and the corresponding Documents.

user: Given the Question and the corresponding Documents, predict the answer to the Question as briefly and accurately as possible based on the Documents. Only give the brief and accurate answer with the form of **answer** and nothing else.

With these approaches, the SFT data used for the warm start training of these three modules-Query Rewriter, Selector, and Generator-can be obtained. All modules can be fine-tuned using the typical loss function of SFT presented in Equation (17).

## D The Detailed Introduction of the Implementation Details

## D.1 Baselines

The methods detailed below serve as baseline models:

LLM w/o RAG : This approach answers questions solely based on the internal knowledge embedded within LLMs, without employing any retrieval mechanisms.

Vanilla RAG w/o train : This method leverages a retrieval model to obtain relevant documents, thereby augmenting the LLM's internal knowledge with external sources. Here, the LLM remains in a pre-trained state and has not undergone any fine-tuning.

Vanilla RAG w SFT : Building on the Vanilla RAG framework, this variant involves a fine-tuned LLM to improve the integration of retrieved external knowledge with the LLM's internal knowledge, potentially enhancing the quality of final answers.

SELF-RAG [1]: This innovative framework advances LLM performance by incorporating both adaptive retrieval mechanisms and self-reflection processes, aiming to produce precise and dependable answers.

RetRobust [54]: This approach fortifies the RAG architecture against irrelevant contexts, thereby boosting its effectiveness in open-domain question-answering scenarios.

Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [30]: A small-scale query rewriter model is trained using reinforcement learning, optimizing the interaction between retrieval and answer generation.

BGM [22]: Utilizing PPO, this method trains a bridge component to filter and identify documents that are more likely to be helpful, thus refining the quality of the retrieved context.

RAG-DDR [27]: This approach utilize DPO to align data preferences between different modules, enhancing performance and reducing hallucinations in RAG.

## D.2 Implementation Details

To ensure fairness in comparison, all baselines were re-implemented using Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the backbone architecture. Within these methods, the untuned modules employed the pre-trained version of Llama-3-8B-Instruct, whereas the trainable modules were derived through specific SFT processes on Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Notably, in the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read framework, the query rewrite module, which is trainable, was optimized using the PPO algorithm applied to Llama-38B-Instruct; meanwhile, answer generation was implemented based on the SFT-refined backbone. Regarding the BGM method, we rebuilt the bridge to connect the retrieval model and the generation model, leveraging Llama-3-8B-Instruct, with this bridge being trained using the PPO algorithm. The generation model for BGM was similarly obtained from the SFT-refined backbone.

We utilize Contriever [16] as the Retriever. Regardless of how many sub-questions subq the Query Rewriter generates from the initial question q , the Selector consistently receives a fixed set of K = 10 documents as input. For example, if the Query Rewriter yields 2 sub-questions, each sub-question is used for retrieval, with the top-5 documents from each retrieval being selected as part of the candidate documents D for the Selector. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that we do not utilize any support facts or positive passages 4 that come with the official datasets to generate answers. Instead, we only use the K candidate documents from the retrieval model as external knowledge for answer generation.

Besides, we also employ Llama-3-8B-Instruct [7] as the foundational LLM for the baselines and MMOA-RAG. Building on the PPO code from LLama-Factory 5 [60], we have developed MMOARAG, which optimizes the RAG multi-agent system using Multi-Agent PPO. And the critical hyperparameters of MMOA-RAG are detailed in Table 6.

Table 6: Key hyperparameters in the training process of MMOA-RAG.

## E The Performance of Different Methods Based on Retriever BGE and E5

We firstly perform the training of different methods based on retrieval model Contriever [16], and the results are shown in Table 1.

We further test the trained models on different retriever BGE [47] and E5 [49]. From Table 7, we can see that our MMOA-RAG also surpasses most of baselines on each datasets.

## F Out-of-Domain Experiments

We also conducted out-of-domain (OOD) experiments to evaluate the generalization capabilities of MMOA-RAG compared to the baselines. We trained LLM on HotpotQA dataset and evaluated on the AmbigQA dataset. The experimental results are shown in Table 8.

Table 8: Out-of-domain experimental results: The model is trained on the HotpotQA dataset and tested on the AmbigQA dataset.

| Methods                    |   Acc |    EM |    F1 |
|----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| SELF-RAG [1]               | 26.7  | 24.25 | 36.38 |
| RetRobust [54]             | 34.19 | 31.75 | 44.08 |
| Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [30] | 33.91 | 30.73 | 43.61 |
| BGM[22]                    | 32.58 | 29.77 | 42.07 |
| MMOA-RAG (ours)            | 35.45 | 32.43 | 45.62 |

From Table 8, it is evident that MMOA-RAG demonstrates superior performance in the OOD experiments, underscoring its notable generalization capabilities and effectively. Additionally, it is noteworthy that RetRobust outperforms all other baselines. This can be attributed to its strategy of integrating both relevant and irrelevant data during the SFT process, which significantly enhances the robustness and generalization abilities of the RAG system.

## G Discussion about Training Time and Inference Time

Training Time In our MMOA-RAG framework, multiple agents (modules) are optimized simultaneously, which results in increased training time as the number of agents rises. When we have n agents, the time required for rollouts and updating model parameters becomes n times that of a single agent. However, since this increase in training time is linear relative to the number of agents, it does not lead to an excessively large overhead. Therefore, this is entirely manageable.

Inference Time The inference process of MMOA-RAG follows the workflow outlined in Figure 1. Training with multiple agents does not introduce any additional overhead during the inference phase.

## H Reasons for Using Reward Sharing and Parameter Sharing Strategies

## H.1 Reward sharing

It is through the way of reward sharing that the optimization objectives of multiple modules can be unified and aligned to optimize the quality of the final predicted answer. Multiple modules in MMOA-RAG naturally fit into a fully cooperative relationship, and reward sharing is a near-standard setting in fully cooperative MARL algorithms [34, 29, 55, 3], as fully cooperative modeling only allows all agents to have the same goal (here, F1 score). Therefore, reward sharing is reasonable and necessary here.

## H.2 Parameter sharing

Parameter sharing is also a common and effective strategy in multi-agent reinforcement learning [34, 29, 55, 3]. Parameter sharing means that multiple agents share the parameters of the same policy network instead of maintaining a separate policy network for each agent. The biggest advantage of this approach is that it can reduce the computational and storage overhead: sharing parameters can significantly reduce the total number of parameters of the model, thus reducing the computational complexity and storage requirements. This is particularly important for RAG systems with multiple modules based on LLM, which is an important reason why we chose to use the parameter sharing strategy.

However, it is undeniable that parameter sharing does have its limitations: it can lead to instability when the number of agents increases. However, in our framework, there are three agents (modules) that are jointly optimized, and the problem of instability generally does not occur when the number of agents is small. The experimental results also prove that under the setting of parameter sharing, the functions of Query Rewriter, Selctor and Generator are not affected at all, and they can complete the task well and exceed the baselines without parameter sharing such as RRR and BGM.

To summarize, we adopt the Settings of parameter sharing and reward sharing commonly used in previous MARL frameworks, which are common and versatile multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks. Agents are distinguished by different prompts, which correspond to different observations of different agents. Therefore, there doesn't have to be a distinction at the architectural or parameter level to be called different agents.

## I Case Study

In this section, we analyze the question from the HotpotQA dataset: 'The Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team currently competes in a conference that was formerly known as what from 1988 to 1996?' The golden answer to this question is 'the North Atlantic Conference.' We compare two inference cases, Inference Case 1 involves the response process of MMOA-RAG after MAPPO training, while Inference Case 2 pertains to the response process before MAPPO training, where only SFT was conducted:

- In Inference Case 1, we observe that the LLM reformulates the initial question q into two sub-questions subq . In Candidate Documents D , Document 0 to 4 are retrieved based on Sub-question 1, and Documents 5 to 9 are retrieved based on Sub-question 2. Notably, the answer highlighted in red appears in Document 5, which the Selector accurately identifies. The

final answer generated based on the Initial question q and Document 5 is 'North Atlantic Conference,' consistent with the Golden answer Ans golden. This process effectively demonstrates how, after MAPPO training, multiple modules can collaborate accurately to provide the most precise answer possible.

- In contrast, Inference Case 2 shows that the LLM only reformulates the initial question q into a single Sub-question 1. All 10 candidate documents are retrieved based on this Sub-question 1. Upon inspection, none of these documents contain text that can answer the initial question. The Selector also chooses multiple documents, which clearly does not aid in generating the correct answer. Consequently, the predicted answer Ans predict is the incorrect 'Yankee Conference.' Hence, prior to MAPPO training, despite each module being well-optimized through SFT, there is a lack of effective collaboration among the modules, potentially leading to inaccurate responses.

These examples provide an intuitive understanding of the advantages of joint multi-module optimization within the complex RAG framework.
